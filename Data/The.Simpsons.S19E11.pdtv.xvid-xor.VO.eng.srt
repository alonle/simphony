The Simpsons S19E11 (KABFO4)
- That '90s Show -

2
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:37,842
Dad, I'm freezing.

3
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:39,149
Don't worry, kids.

4
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,934
These wool socks and down
parkas will keep you warm.

5
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,407
We wouldn't be in
this trouble if you'd just

6
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:49,737
paid the heating bill !

7
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:52,198
I thought global warming
would take care of it.

8
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,342
Al Gore can't do
anything right.

9
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:56,082
I got some old
magazines to burn.

10
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:57,720
Popular Science.

11
00:00:58,933 --> 00:00:59,889
Redbook.

12
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,169
Big & Tall Halloween
Costume catalogue.

13
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,255
Next item.

14
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,252
No ! ! ! ! !

15
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:14,662
Mom, I didn't know
you went to college !

16
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,442
Yeah, you always said
that after high school,

17
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:19,670
Dad "blessed" you with
the unplanned miracle of me.

18
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:23,313
Hey, parents are allowed
to keep some secrets.

19
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:25,210
Like which kid's
their favorite !

20
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:26,280
It's Lisa.

21
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:32,543
You know, Mom and Dad
are almost 40, and Bart is ten.

22
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:36,370
That means you didn't have him
until way after high school.

23
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,052
Yeah, what happened while
I was chillin' in Dad's junk ?

24
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,060
There is a part of our past that

25
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,223
we haven't told you kids about.

26
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:45,043
A turbulent part.

27
00:01:45,077 --> 00:01:47,411
Come on.
More turbulent than now ?

28
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:49,483
We're in every kind of therapy.

29
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:52,342
Things happened between your mother
and me that we're not proud of.

30
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:55,962
It was the middle of a wild decade
known as the 1990s.

31
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,741
The '90s ? Never heard of it.

32
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,973
Oh, it was a wonderful time.

33
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:02,402
The Iraq war was over
once and for all,

34
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:05,363
a struggling Matt Groening
created Futurama,

35
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:07,902
and young people
believed in their dreams,

36
00:02:07,926 --> 00:02:11,701
thanks to a TV show
called Melrose Place.

37
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:13,960
<i>Your mother and I were dating,</i>

38
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,333
<i>and we had just moved into</i>

39
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,940
<i>our first apartment together.</i>

40
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,281
Luann, a picture of
you cheating on me

41
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:25,020
is downloading
onto my computer.

42
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:27,871
I'll know who you were with
in less than six hours !

43
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:29,730
Unless someone
picks up the phone.

44
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:31,282
No, no, no, no ! Oh !

45
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:33,463
<i>We didn't have a lot of money,</i>

46
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:35,271
<i>but we were young and in love.</i>

47
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:37,990
Oh !

48
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:40,142
I'm afraid it's
Top Ramen again.

49
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:41,083
With you, baby,

50
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:43,661
Top Ramen tastes
like Cup O' Noodles.

51
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:51,253
You know, these IKEA foam
futons do Velcro together.

52
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,313
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

53
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:55,152
I'm not ready
to do that yet.

54
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:56,902
I want to wait
until I'm married,

55
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:58,210
or at least really drunk.

56
00:02:58,287 --> 00:02:59,211
I understand.

57
00:02:59,218 --> 00:03:02,122
We should follow the lead
of today's celebrity role models.

58
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:03,791
Sonic The hedghog says
"Wait until marriage".

59
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,252
<i>Like all young people,</i>

60
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:06,460
<i>I had a musical dream,</i>

61
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:08,592
<i>a dream called inoffensive urban light</i>

62
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:10,283
<i>hip-hop smooth grooves.</i>

63
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:12,723
Okay, everyone,
let's warm up our harmonies.

64
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,220
<i>Homer</i>

65
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:15,371
<i>Lenny</i>

66
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:16,333
<i>Carl</i>

67
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:17,890
<i>Lou the Cop</i>

68
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:24,811
<i>I'll make rub to you
Show respect for you</i>

69
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:30,183
<i>Hug so safe and strong
Backrub all night long !</i>

70
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:32,590
<i>I'll make rub to you !</i>

71
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:35,473
<i>But our happiness
was about to unravel</i>

72
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:37,981
<i>just like Kevin Costner's career:</i>

73
00:03:37,997 --> 00:03:40,103
<i>because of the postman.</i>

74
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:42,031
You applied to college ?

75
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:43,310
Why didn't you tell me ?

76
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:44,551
I did tell you.

77
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:46,420
I thought you were
telling me you wanted

78
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,990
to apply yourself to
making a collage.

79
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:50,612
And as I recall,
I was against it.

80
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:52,523
I can't believe I got in.

81
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:54,503
It's like a dream come true.

82
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:57,233
An expensive dream.

83
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:04,002
Oh, baby, you deserve
every last bit of it !

84
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:05,163
I can get the money,

85
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,841
but it'll mean swallowing
my pride and working for...

86
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:09,443
my dad !

87
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:12,173
Well, Well, Well, 

88
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:15,801
look who's come crawling back
to work for your old man.

89
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:17,523
What do you need
the money for ?

90
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,123
Medicine ?

91
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:20,222
None of your business.

92
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:22,060
Now give me a job
at your business.

93
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:22,893
You're dead !

94
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,313
Die ! Die ! Die !

95
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:25,300
Suck my beam !

96
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:29,192
Okay, all right !
Time's up !

97
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:36,913
This counts as your break.

98
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:39,000
<i>But Marge's education was worth</i>

99
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:41,950
<i>all the pistol-whipping in the world.</i>

100
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:44,562
This place is just
like the brochure:

101
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:46,321
Autumn leaves.

102
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:47,950
Bull sessions.

103
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,271
And that is why

104
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:51,761
The Lord of the Rings
can never be filmed.

105
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:54,702
Fraternity pledges
in their beanies.

106
00:04:54,735 --> 00:04:57,821
I think I'm gonna like it here.

107
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:04,243
So, have you all bought the required
textbooks for this class ?

108
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:05,723
Good.

109
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:07,760
Now throw them all away !

110
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,531
Everything you think you
know about history is a lie.

111
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:17,260
For example:
the Founding Fathers.

112
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,522
What did they have in common ?

113
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:19,511
They defied a king ?

114
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:21,912
They created a system
of checks and balances ?

115
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:22,753
Wrong !

116
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:26,520
They were all white, Protestant,
property-owning males.

117
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:30,242
Evil

118
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:37,902
Are you saying that America was
founded on misconceptions ?

119
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:39,123
Who said that ?

120
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:47,983
That is exactly
what I'm saying.

121
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:52,623
<i>Fall semester,</i>
<i>you just got interesting.</i>

122
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:54,833
The bridges of
Madison county.

123
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:58,773
This book sucks so much.

124
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:01,952
Homie, my mind has been
opened in so many ways !

125
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,120
Did you know that
every US president

126
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:06,273
has been a straight white man ?

127
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,890
Even Walt Disney ?

128
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:11,110
And did you also know that history
is written by the winners ?

129
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:11,610
Really ?

130
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:13,482
I thought it was
written by losers.

131
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:17,701
If you think that,

132
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:19,251
you should meet my
new professor.

133
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:23,183
Professor August has shown me
a side of the world I never knew.

134
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,651
Professor August, eh ?

135
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:26,992
Who is he, somegray-haired
old bookworm ?

136
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:29,040
Uh, not exactly.

137
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:29,842
Marge,

138
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,681
I hope I'll be seeing you
tomorrow during office hours.

139
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:36,563
Uh, 3:00 to 5:00, right ?

140
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,771
If my beads are parted,
come right in.

141
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:40,453
I will !

142
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:44,822
To the faculty club !

143
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:50,690
I never heard that noise before.

144
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:51,769
Are you sick ?

145
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:56,279
Hmm. I wonder what's on your mind.

146
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:03,585
Okay, I relate your pilot light.

147
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,071
Now I just need to do a
little work on the thermostat.

148
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:08,371
Would you like me to
tell you a story while I work ?

149
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:10,620
One about a woman
I loved and lost ?

150
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,750
We're in the middle of
our own story, thank you.

151
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:15,563
Right. No one wants to hear
about the gasman's girl.

152
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:18,501
"Just shut up, monkey man,
and make the gas flow. "

153
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:21,061
Anyway,
I was growing to admire

154
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,592
my professor more and more.

155
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:26,070
...so that's why
instead of "X-X",

156
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:29,233
I think of the female genes
in a more positive light...

157
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,152
Plus-Plus.

158
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:37,070
Professor, do you think
white male scientists

159
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:40,870
have marginalized the
contributions of the Third World ?

160
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:41,691
Great question.

161
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:43,661
And the answer is "of course. "

162
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:46,072
Could a tribe of bushmen
have invented penicillin ?

163
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:47,382
Maybe they already have.

164
00:07:47,386 --> 00:07:48,712
But no one asked them.

165
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,820
No one asked them.

166
00:07:57,015 --> 00:08:01,593
Oh, Elaine, will you ever find
someone who's sponge-worthy ?

167
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:05,513
Professor August says the situation
comedy is a doomed genre.

168
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:06,882
Here's what I say to that:

169
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:07,730
no soup for you !

170
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,582
Because I am "master of my domain".

171
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:12,243
Newman.

172
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:14,671
I wish you would support my comments.

173
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:17,331
Hey, I worked hard all day
to pay for your education.

174
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:19,022
Can't I get all Zima'd up and have

175
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:21,431
my best girl put salve
on my laser burns ?

176
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:24,432
Are the lasers supposed to burn you ?

177
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:26,112
Apparently if all the kids fire

178
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:28,511
at your stomach at once, it adds up.

179
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:49,183
<i>Closing time open all the doors</i>

180
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:53,813
<i>and let you out into the world...</i>

181
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:59,641
Marge, your art project for
"protest studies" is very impressive.

182
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:04,522
Thank you, Professor August.

183
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,293
Oh, please, I'm your advisor.

184
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,460
Call me Steffan.

185
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,270
Oh, thanks.

186
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:13,522
It-it's just a note
from my boyfriend.

187
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:14,382
Let me guess:

188
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,730
he's a high school flame

189
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:17,223
who's preventing you
from flowering.

190
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:18,801
Homer's perfect for me !

191
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,112
Just look at this note:

192
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:22,022
"I miss you. "Aww.

193
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:24,942
Actually, Marge, if I may
deconstruct that letter.

194
00:09:24,945 --> 00:09:26,742
When he writes "I miss you,"

195
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:29,611
"I" is the subject
and "you" is the object.

196
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:31,730
You are his object.

197
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:33,491
But Homer's so supportive.

198
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:35,722
He's paying for me
to go to college.

199
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:37,142
He's paying for you ?

200
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:38,440
Like he owns you ?

201
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:40,402
I'm sorry, but that is oppression.

202
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:43,442
Well, I know you'd never say
anything that isn't objective...

203
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:45,243
Marge, your assignment is
to think about

204
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:47,342
what I've said about
your relationship.

205
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:48,571
When is it due ?

206
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,890
Before it's too late.

207
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:52,492
Steffan !

208
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:54,251
Marge ! Marge !

209
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:55,311
Where are you ? !

210
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:59,893
Are you by that
Joan Miro Statue ?

211
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:01,762
lt's "Juan" Miro !

212
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,410
Stupid townie !

213
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:07,212
Hey, it's townies like me
that cook your food and

214
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:08,140
clean your bathrooms !

215
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:11,953
If you did the former better
we'd use the latter less.

216
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:14,551
That's it, townie !

217
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:15,221
Run !

218
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:17,170
Run back to your town !

219
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:20,311
Marge, this dreamcatcher
was given to me by a warrior

220
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:23,422
of the Lakopane tribe,
a tribe ruled by women.

221
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:25,422
I think it has already
caught my dream.

222
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:31,722
What the hell is
going on here ?

223
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:32,581
Chanting ? !

224
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,513
Homer !
You're embarrassing me !

225
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,982
Marge, what are you doing
in this crazy college ?

226
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:39,310
This place is nothing
like Animal House !

227
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:42,953
I smashed a beatnik's guitar
and he sued me for damages !

228
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:44,883
Successfully !

229
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:46,392
Homie, go home.

230
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:47,961
We'll talk about this later.

231
00:10:47,968 --> 00:10:48,693
Fine !

232
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:52,292
Slam !

233
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,242
I can't do it !

234
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:01,921
Our harmony-laden R&B doesn't

235
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,651
make sense in this cruel world.

236
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,582
I'm taking our music to
the next level :

237
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:09,892
Guitar Rock Utilizing
Nihilist Grunge Energies.

238
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:12,533
Or, as I call it: Grunge !

239
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:14,833
We are Sadgasm,

240
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:16,531
and this song is called...

241
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,602
"Politically Incorrect. "

242
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:30,372
Pain is brown

243
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:34,271
Hate is white

244
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,322
Love is black

245
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:42,430
Stab the night

246
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:47,113
Kingdom of numb

247
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:51,082
Closet of hurt

248
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:55,553
Feelings are dumb

249
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,603
Kisses are dirt...

250
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:00,602
Kurt ? Kurt ?

251
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:01,521
It's Marvin !

252
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:03,781
Your cousin, Marvin Cobain !

253
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:05,640
You know that new sound
you're looking for ?

254
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:06,953
Well, listen to this !

255
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:12,753
Marge ! Marge !

256
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:17,193
Hey, Marge.

257
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:20,153
Homer, your music is
so angry and bitter.

258
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:21,733
Now why would I be angry and bitter ?

259
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:23,711
Because I'm paying for
you to make goo-goo eyes

260
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:25,680
at some smooth-talking professor ?

261
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:27,073
Well, here's a question for you:

262
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:30,360
why should I stay with a man
who resents how I've flowered ?

263
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,271
Well, if you feel that
way maybe you can find

264
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:34,531
someone who wants to
nurture the new you,

265
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:37,273
maybe someone a little
older and more sophisticated,

266
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:40,423
who can take you to
Europe during the summer.

267
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,281
- Fine by me.
- D'oh !

268
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:48,812
Hey. Will you sign my boobs ?

269
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:49,690
Yeah.

270
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:51,691
Marge come back.

271
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:58,923
Mom, why did you stop talking
for two and a half minutes ?

272
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:00,460
It seemed like 20.

273
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:01,213
Whatever.

274
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:03,382
Homer and I had the wrenching task

275
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,722
of dividing up a shared life.

276
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:09,663
Okay, I'll keep the LPs,
and you take the CDs.

277
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,941
I'll take the typewriter;
you take the computer.

278
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:15,021
I'll take the Enron stock;
you take the Microsoft stock.

279
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:15,902
And, um...

280
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:18,212
Who gets... Cutie-puss ?

281
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:20,900
I just want a tentacle.

282
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:36,003
<i>I was so depressed,</i>

283
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:38,750
<i>I spent all my time in a bar.</i>

284
00:13:38,778 --> 00:13:40,000
Gimme a beer, Moe.

285
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:41,472
I don't sell booze no more.

286
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:43,242
This is a cigar bar now.

287
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,472
Fine. Cohiba me.

288
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:49,303
Leave the humidor.

289
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,440
I don't feel so good.

290
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:03,570
I wasn't trying to steal your watch.

291
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,510
I-I was just comin' on to ya.

292
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:08,573
Okay, let's go back
to my place.

293
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:09,700
Oh, boy.

294
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:13,041
Ready to take my personal
tour of Springfield's

295
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:15,813
most wheelchair-unfriendly
restaurants ?

296
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,260
I sure am !

297
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:19,603
I want your knowledge inside me.

298
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:28,320
Seeing Marge always
reminds me of Marge.

299
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:34,741
Now where will I get my oxygen ?

300
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:45,132
Razorblade of apathy

301
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:48,823
Shave me with your irony

302
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,811
Shave me !

303
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,062
Shave me !

304
00:14:57,795 --> 00:15:00,681
Have you really read
all of these books ?

305
00:15:00,686 --> 00:15:03,521
Morally, I couldn't display
them on shelves if I hadn't.

306
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:04,901
But I watch sports as well,

307
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:06,733
just like a regular man.

308
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:09,071
Good Goddess !

309
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:12,391
The Patriots deep
in Redskin territory.

310
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:13,852
This isn't entertainment;

311
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:15,373
it's genocide !

312
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:21,382
Why don't we put on some music ?

313
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:22,891
Shave me !

314
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:24,513
No ! No !

315
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:26,072
I need whale songs !

316
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:27,081
Oceans of the sea

317
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:36,042
Marge, may I compliment
your appearance ?

318
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:37,070
Yeah, sure.

319
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:38,693
You look lovely.

320
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:40,660
If I were to approach you for a kiss,

321
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,922
would you construe
that as harassment

322
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:44,381
or give your willing consent ?

323
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:46,363
Consent, of course.

324
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:48,772
Ah. Continuing in that line of thought,

325
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:51,720
may I kiss your mouth with my mouth ?

326
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:53,550
Just do it already !

327
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:59,202
<i>I had finally realized
every rock star's dream:</i>

328
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,032
<i>hating being famous.</i>

329
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:08,452
Why aren't I happy ?

330
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:11,500
I'm the hottest grunge
artist on Mucous Records.

331
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:13,841
Weird Al is doing
a parody of my song.

332
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:17,493
Raisin bread with applesauce

333
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:21,490
Tony Danza, he's the boss

334
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:24,250
Brain freeze !

335
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:26,492
Brain freeze !

336
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,702
Brain freeze !

337
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:30,753
Brain freeze !

338
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:35,600
He who is tired of Weird
Al is tired of life.

339
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:39,323
Look at that lighthouse.

340
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:43,392
That's the ultimate expression of
phallocentric technocracy,

341
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:45,162
violating Mother Sky.

342
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:47,593
I thought they were just
tall so boats could see them.

343
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:48,330
No, Marge.

344
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:50,662
Everything penis-shaped is bad.

345
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:54,273
Look, a wedding !

346
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,590
Slavery is alive and
well in Springfield.

347
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,530
You oppose marriage ?

348
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:02,740
Marge, marriage has
oppressed women for centuries.

349
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:03,921
But, Steffan,

350
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:06,282
I would like to get married someday.

351
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:10,730
Oh, Marge, it's statements like that
make people say women are stupid.

352
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,430
It's statements like that that...

353
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:13,422
are mean !

354
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:14,910
Well, it may sound mean,

355
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,010
but I'm just trying
to help you evolve.

356
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:19,743
Oh, evolve yourself,
Professor Jerk !

357
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,531
Or should I say,
Associate Professor Jerk !

358
00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:30,192
I only got denied tenure because
my department head is an idiot !

359
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,673
Der, duh, what did
you say about me ?

360
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,311
I'm sorry, Professor Moose.

361
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:38,092
You're about to get your PhD...

362
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,131
Pound Head Down.

363
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:54,463
<i>Spread yellow gunk
on my pancake heart</i>

364
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:57,963
<i>Country-churned girl
in my grocery cart...</i>

365
00:17:57,965 --> 00:18:00,432
Could he be singing about me ?

366
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:03,842
He is !

367
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:06,082
<i>I paid for her dreams</i>

368
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:08,011
<i>She taught me to cry</i>

369
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:09,521
<i>Like watery knives</i>

370
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:11,790
<i>Like rain from my eyes</i>

371
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:17,321
<i>I can't believe you're not mine</i>

372
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,611
<i>I can't believe you're not mine</i>

373
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:26,752
<i>Mar-ge-rine</i>

374
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:30,602
<i>Mar-ge-rine</i>

375
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:34,552
<i>Mar-ge-rine</i>

376
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:37,981
<i>Mar-ge-rine !</i>

377
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:41,892
<i>Mar-ge-rine !</i>

378
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:45,681
He loves me so much
after what I did to him.

379
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:51,072
We interrupt this "Bleak Block"
to bring you a breaking story.

380
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:54,283
Grunge trailblazer
Sadgasm have broken up.

381
00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:58,361
Reclusive front man
Homer Simpson has

382
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:00,613
holed himself up in his
mansion, as rumors swirled

383
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:03,201
about an out-of-control
narcotics addiction.

384
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:04,970
This is Kurt Loder reporting from...

385
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:05,770
the '90s.

386
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:08,792
No, narcotics !

387
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:16,680
Oh, my God, you're a junkie !

388
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:18,053
I need it...

389
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,690
I'm getting you off this stuff.

390
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:21,101
But I need it !

391
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:22,631
No, you don't !

392
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:29,592
<i>Unfortunately, as I later learned,</i>

393
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:30,783
<i>that wasn't heroin.</i>

394
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:31,820
<i>It was insulin.</i>

395
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:34,290
Homer really did
need those injections.

396
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:37,980
I had become diabetic from
drinking too many Frappuccinos.

397
00:19:39,196 --> 00:19:42,051
Homie, I got so caught
up in the world of college

398
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:44,833
that I forgot how
important your love was.

399
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:47,262
Can you find it in your
heart to take me back ?

400
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:48,331
Of course.

401
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:52,110
The thing that stood between us
the '90s is almost over.

402
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:52,853
You're right.

403
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:55,110
But I'm worried about
what's on the horizon:

404
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:57,452
reality shows, Britney Spears,

405
00:19:57,455 --> 00:20:00,150
the suspicious number
of home runs being hit...

406
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:03,260
At least we know there'll never be
a president worse than Bill Clinton.

407
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:06,740
Imagine, lying in a
deposition in a civil lawsuit.

408
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,290
That's the worst sin a
president could commit.

409
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:11,403
There'll never be
a worse president.

410
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,141
Never.

411
00:20:12,257 --> 00:20:13,010
Never.

412
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:15,223
<i>With the '90s drawing to a close,</i>

413
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:17,313
<i>and the Sydney Olympics
to look forward to,</i>

414
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,002
<i>our love rekindled.</i>

415
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:20,623
<i>And one moonlight night,</i>

416
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:23,753
<i>I finally had fun at
a mini-golf course.</i>

417
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:29,011
<i>Homer, stop !</i>

418
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:31,843
You don't have to tell
the kids everything !

419
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,770
What did I miss ?
How did it end ?

420
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,192
You two ever get back together ?

421
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:37,790
Yep, that professor couldn't
keep me and Marge apart.

422
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:40,882
I mean, unless he had been
a little nicer at the beach.

423
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:45,290
Well, that professor did
teach me one good lesson:

424
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:47,801
Homie is where my heart is.

425
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:50,892
And once we were back together,

426
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:54,080
I was to happy ever to grunge again.

427
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,912
Townies.
