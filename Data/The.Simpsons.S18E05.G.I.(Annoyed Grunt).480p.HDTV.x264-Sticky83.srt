2
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,083
<i>Hustle up, guys.
You've got to get that defector</i>

3
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,657
<i>and get the hell out of there.
No delays.</i>

4
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,844
Hey, Mouse, are you ready
with that 18-year-old aim?

5
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,747
I'm on it, sir.

6
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,980
Move. Let's go.

7
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,209
All right, come on.
Where is this guy at?

8
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,113
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on.

9
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,378
All right, Mouse.
Give us that diversion.

10
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,853
Let's move.

11
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,756
Flint, stay put.

12
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,916
Anyone ever tell you
you fight ugly?

13
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,626
Not from their backs, they don't.

14
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,086
It's just...

15
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,713
Flint, let's go. Flint?

16
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,423
What the hell are you doing?

17
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,167
<i>Just marking
our territory, sir.</i>

18
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,552
Private Gaines,
if you see Flint, shoot him.

19
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,079
With pleasure.

20
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:09,382
Defector in hand.
En route to pickup. Come on.

21
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,191
I don't see him, do you?

22
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,112
<i>Flint, get your ass
back to the team.</i>

23
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,890
<i>We are on the move.</i>

24
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,477
Uh, you ain't gonna
believe this, Roadblock.

25
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,947
Mother...

26
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,494
Yeah!

27
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,833
What?

28
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,522
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.
Unfair advantage.

29
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:52,648
I'm better.

30
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,776
He's got smooth cheeks.
He's got no facial hair.

31
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,820
- I'm gonna pull the pin.
- There's less friction underwater.

32
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,814
That's a foul.
That's a foul.

33
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,450
A Joe flag.

34
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,617
A G.l. Joe flag.

35
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,019
That was a
nice touch, right?

36
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,954
Yeah. You can call it that.

37
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,356
And what would you call it?

38
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,616
- Undignified.
- Yeah, that, too.

39
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,411
You know in victory,
we should be gentlemen.

40
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,965
Oh!

41
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,049
- Yo!

42
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,010
How long can
the average man hold his breath?

43
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,219
Ninety seconds.

44
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,679
- Free hand.
- You got it, boss.

45
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,753
All right. Easy, Flipper.

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,019
Mmm.

47
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,093
Back. Damn, that's good.

48
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,985
There's nothing wrong with
taking a victory lap. It's fun.

49
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,613
This is how it works.
G.l. Joe's a fist.

50
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,490
Us, we're the knuckles.

51
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,892
How do we strike?

52
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,393
Together.

53
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,936
A finger strays...

54
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,605
- It gets broken.
- It gets broken.

55
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,165
Knuckles, again? Really?

56
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,375
As a friend,
you've got to get a new speech.

57
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,528
And the next time
you want to drown somebody,

58
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,214
just invite me.

59
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,976
<i>Since the end
of the nanomite wars,</i>

60
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,881
<i>Captain Duke Hauser now leads
Joe Tactical Operations.</i>

61
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,598
<i>Under Duke's command are Roadblock,</i>

62
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,013

<i>Flint</i>

64
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,309
<i>and Snake Eyes.</i>

65
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,815
<i>The ruthless terrorist known
as Cobra Commander,</i>

66
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,526
<i>and Destro</i>

67
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,086
<i>have been captured by the G.
I. Joes</i>

68
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,161
<i>and placed in
a maximum security prison.</i>

69
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,002
<i>But the Cobra operatives,
Storm Shadow</i>

70
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,720
<i>and Zartan, remain at large.</i>

71
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,931
<i>The unit and the world</i>

72
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,836
<i>remain on high alert following
Cobra Commander's final vow.</i>

73
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,097
<i>Retaliation.</i>

74
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,434
The ear that sees.

75
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,509
An ancient Arashikage test.

76
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,429
Jinx, cousin to Storm Shadow,

77
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:51,445
it's time to prove that you are
ready to join the G.l. Joes.

78
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,696
Defend yourself.

79
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,955
I'm ready, Blind Master.

80
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,410
Ears, open.

81
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,672
Snake Eyes, your task.

82
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,220
Test her abilities.

83
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,857
Pluck a single hair
from Jinx's head.

84
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,076
Ah, good.

85
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,537
One should be as nimble as a cat,

86
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,749
yet fierce as a tiger.

87
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,706
Snake Eyes wins.

88
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,374
Jinx, in order to excel in war,

89
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,373
you must first find peace.

90
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,211
Snake Eyes,

91
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,261
you have earned the
Blade of Justice.

92
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,894
Made of black carbon fibre.

93
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,977
Cruel. Indestructible.

94
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,565
There are rumours of a new attack
by our enemies.

95
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,571
You must leave the dojo to uncover
these plans and stop them.

96
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,662
But move swiftly.
You may already be too late.

97
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,493
<i>Contact front!
Contact front!</i>

98
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,179
<i>Heavy enemy fire! I need you to bring
them up the line. Bring them up the line.</i>

99
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,347
<i>Check that, Block,
but I can't, man.</i>

100
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,515
<i>I'm taking rounds back here.</i>

101
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,766
<i>I need you!
I need you now!</i>

102
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,143
<i>Air strike! Call in an air strike!</i>

103
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,354
Wait. How do you
call in an air strike?

104
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,688
- Jesus!
- Can I bring...

105
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,024
What about one of those, like,
care package thingies?

106
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,099
I'm bleeding out
and I need you to sprint.

107
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,530
Can you use a care package thingy?
I can bring you one.

108
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,281
A care package thingy?

109
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,525
Who is shooting me? What is...

110
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,103
I'm bleeding out right
there and you're...

111
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,666
Are you spinning?

112
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,042
You got to cover 360.

113
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,252
- You're spinning.
- Huh?

114
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,879
How could you be so good at combat?
You stink at this.

115
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,090
I think you need to relax.
I believe I outrank you,

116
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,883
- last time I checked.
- Not in my house, you don't.

117
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,886
Oh! All right. Taking fire!

118
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,055
Enemy fire!
Time out! Enemy fire!

119
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,183
Enemy contact!

120
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,102
Uncle Duke, you have big ears.

121
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,730
You got a big head.
Come here!

122
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,440
Returning fire!
What's up, now?

123
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,152
Returning fire!

124
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,070
You can't scream your way
out of this one!

125
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,572
Yeah, requesting assistance,
brother Block!

126
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,282
Pinned down, brother Duke.
Pinned down.

127
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,242
That's all right. I got my boy here.
Demon dog!

128
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,457
Grandma, help us!
We need backup!

129
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,656
Not the first time you sent a girl
running out of the room screaming.

130
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:16,538
Not the first time I sent two
girls screaming from a room.

131
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,162
Dude, completely inappropriate.

132
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,430
- I'm just saying.
- Completely.

133
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,973
<i>Violence continues across Pakistan</i>

134
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,308

<i>as the vacuum created

139
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,448
The Pakistani
President may in fact be dead,

140
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,284
but Pakistan remains an ally.

141
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,857
And a sovereign nation.

142
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,579
Was.

143
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,358
Right now, they're a
riot with a zip code.

144
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,001
Sir, every minute
we spend debating this,

145
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,128
there are live nuclear warheads

146
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,796
that sit amidst the chaos.

147
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,326
We can't let our enemies
get those warheads first.

148
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,546
Recommendations?

149
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,709
Go in.

150
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,470
Now.

151
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,718
Wait and see.

152
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,070
History rewards the bold.

153
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,645
I'm not going to be the man
who waited and saw.

154
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,312

That nuke cannot have gone far.
Once we have it,

158
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,130
we will disarm it en
route to the L.Z.!

159
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,966
We have its location narrowed down

160
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,343
to somewhere in this
missile assembly building.

161
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,595
We'll go in on the roof,
and fan out from there.

162
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,015
Flint, Jaye, if any support is needed,
you'll reinforce

163

Hell, yeah.

Hey, Mouse.

166
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,237
On my first drop I popped a
live round into my mouth.

167
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,517
Keeps your teeth from chattering.
Give it a shot.

168
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,737
- Delicious.
- Attaboy.

169
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,205
Jaye, what are we up against?

170
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,999
Insurgents are armed
with Kalashnikovs,

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,868
SVD Dragunovs and Type 50s.

172
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,779
Cold War stuff.

173
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,921
But don't relax, boys,
still put holes in you.

174
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,715
Whoa! What have you got there?

00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:24,344
P-dub 381 black Tempest,

When did we get these?

178
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,393
We didn't. We did.

179
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,478
Distinguished Marksmen.

180
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,756
- Let me see.
- Don't touch.

181
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,307
Girls with guns.

182
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,826
Approaching target.
Ten-hut! Make ready!

183
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,244
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

184
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,496
Anyone else missing Snake Eyes?

185
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,290
I trained with Snake for six years.

186
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,417
If he ain't here,
he's got good reason.

187
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,586
<i>Arch-Angel, go for drop.</i>

188
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,755
Brother Block, as always,

189
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,424
would you mind leading us
in a few words, please, sir?

190
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,427
In the immortal words of Jay-Z,

191
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,378
"Whatever deity may guide my life,

192
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,851
"dear Lord, don't
let me die tonight."

193
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,505
"But if I shall, before I wake,"

194
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,554
"I accept my fate."

195
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,359
Hell, yeah?

196
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,860
Hell, yeah!

197
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,604
Hell, yeah.

198
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,117
Equipment check!

199
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,120
- Check!
- Check!

200
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,458
- Check!
- Check!

201
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,362
- Check!
- Drive it like you stole it!

202
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,132
As your good friend,
you need a new catchphrase.

203
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,128
- Hoo-ah!
Hoo-ah!

204
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,258
<i>Alpha, Bravo, radio check.</i>

205
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,558
<i>Copy.</i>

206
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,548
<i>Go in ghost
till first contact.</i>

207
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,026
<i>- Three and six on the ﬂoor.</i>
- Copy that.

208
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,777
<i>Team two, expect heavy contact.
Bring the rain!</i>

209
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,578
Move out!

210
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,463
<i>Team three headed upstairs.</i>

211
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,164
<i>East hallway, clear.</i>

212
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,780
<i>Level 2 secure.
Moving to level 3.</i>

213
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,115
<i>- I owe you one, Mouse</i>
- Clear!

214
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,229
All right! I got eyes on the nuke!

215
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,148
<i>Say again, I got eyes on the nuke!</i>

216
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,569
But I'm taking heavy fire!

217
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,362
<i>Sit tight! I'm
taking a detour!</i>

218
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,106
<i>Negative, Flint!
Stick with the plan!</i>

219
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,282
Tangos down!

220
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,121
Go, 90, 90!

221
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,997
Flint, status!

222
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,675
<i>Fire now!</i>

223
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,182
Weapons secured!

224
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,151
<i>Equipment
pack-up on level four!</i>

225
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,277
Set!

226
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,305
Clutch, station
the transport vehicle! Move!

227
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,523
<i>All teams,
rally to transpo, immediately.</i>

228
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,438
<i>Insurgents closing in, sir!</i>

229
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,790
<i>Team two secure. No losses.</i>

230
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,125
- Contact headquarters.
- I'm on that.

231
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,919
Mount up! Let's exfil.

232
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,993
<i>- Runway secure.</i>
- Let's mount up!

233
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,941
Nuke's disabled.

234
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,944
Long-range transportation
and wheels down at 1900 hours.

235
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,696
Home in time for <i>Top Chef.</i>

236
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,281
Good job, Tiny Tim.

237
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,324
All that Wii Combat Shooter
finally paying off, sir.

238
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,617
Bam!

239
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,827
- How you doing, sir?
- Good.

240
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,370
All Joes present and accounted for.

241
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,538
Sit rep?

242
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,737
Rendered safe
and ready for transport, sir.

243
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,126
Square this one away
and go get a beer.

244
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,744
- Sounds good.
- Mmm-hmm.

245
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,506
<i>Sir, the nukes have been
recovered and disabled.</i>

246
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,251
<i>All Joe missions successful.</i>

247
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,681
<i>Only minor injuries to report, sir.</i>

248
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,018
<i>Transport crews are prepping
the L.Z. for evac at 0200 hours.</i>

249
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,060
Great job, Captain.

250
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,354
We're modifying
your extraction plan back here.

251
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,098
Sit tight.

252
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,026
Let's go, Rivera, let's go.

253
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,611
Let me
get this straight.

254
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,446
One whole weekend,

255
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,690
you looking after my little girls.

256
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,062
Yep, as long as I can bring this.

257
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,829
Look, I love your kids. I do.

258
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,530
But they live to terrorise me.
You trained them well.

259
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,618
And if you win?

260
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,746
You have to take
your next promotion.

261
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,249
You pull a trigger,
I pull a trigger.

262
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,764
I don't know if I'm gonna trust
a pastry from a gumbo chef.

263
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,300
Think about the wind.

264
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,558
Four knots? Left to right.

265
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,697
Humidity, I say, is about 62%.

266
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,574
You gonna feed me
the barometric pressure, too?

267
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,649
That's on the rise.
Like your panties.

268
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,610
You love my panties.

269
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,626
That's an interesting
choice of a joke.

270
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,419
Of all the things
you could say...

271
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,672
- "You love my panties"?
- Are you gonna shut up?

272
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,199
- What does that mean?
- You gonna shut up?

273
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,926
- I'm looking out for you.
- I'm trying to do something.

274
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,170
- I just don't...
- Shut up, just shut up.

275
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,753
- I'm just saying.
- Just shut up.

276
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,770
How's your heart rate?

277
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,772
That is not gonna count.

278
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,941
I get to go again
because you talked.

279
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,346
You pulled a trigger.
Now I pull a trigger.

280
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,449
No, we're not doing that.

281
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,897
That is not gonna count.

282
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,081
Cheater.

283
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,916
I bought my little girls
a karaoke machine

284
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,294
and they love singing on it,
all night long.

285
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,339
There's no bedtime curfew,
so they're going to be up all night.

286
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,037
Make sure you bring your earplugs.

287
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,385
Boom!

288
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,303
- C'mon, best two out of three.
- No.

289
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,513
Best two out of three.
That didn't count.

290
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,416
You didn't tell me
about the karaoke machine.

291
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,488
Zandar.

292
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,391
Mr President.

293
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,158
Aren't you supposed to stop people
from shooting my dad?

294
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,864
Baldy.

295
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,006
Idiot.

296
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,080
Enough out of you, Lee Harvey.

297
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:04,001
Go clean up the chocolate stains
you left in your mother's bedroom.

298
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,759
Kitty likes to scratch.

299
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,970
Next time,

300
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,813
take out his fat ass.

301
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,182
It would be my pleasure, sir.

302
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,531
I brought you some news.

303
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:38,080
The G.l. Joes are about to be
out of the picture.

304
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:44,166
And by "out of the picture," I mean

305
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,081
alive on earth.

306
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,393
Got a little too close
to Mount Olympus.

307
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,795
Huh?

308
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,097
Had to strike them down.

309
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,402
They'll find you out, Zartan.

310
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,306
No. No, I don't think so.

311
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,076
That's the beauty of nanomites.

312
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,744
Here, take a look.

313
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,146
Hmm?

314
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,134
Flawless microtechnology.

315
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,761
You're insane.

316
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,335
Recess over. Sit him down.

317
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,841
You know, they say
this is a thankless job.

318
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,678
But yesterday I hung out with Bono.

319
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,359
My new Secret Service,

320
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,611
they want to burn the Constitution.

321
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,229
Literally.

322
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,354
And my interns...

323
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,029
Oh, yeah, I brought
back the interns.

324
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,194
Mmm-mmm.

325
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,195
Do you know my favourite bit?
I get to blow stuff up.

326
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,047
Oh, I bet that endears
you to the people.

327
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,299
Well, that's the thing.

328
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,203
Your approval ratings
climbed nine points.

329
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,638
Apparently, America wants
someone who looks like you,

330
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,632
but acts like me.

331
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,383
I'm the quicker blower-upper, baby.

332
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,964
Only one drawback.

333
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,192
- The little wifey-pooh?
- Huh?

334
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,936
If you touch my family...

335
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,639
I'm yanking your chain.

336
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,063
Two long terms of you,

337
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,911
just a few short months of me.

338
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,656
So let's not waste
the time I got left.

339
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:40,156
Where is the prison that holds
Cobra Commander and Destro?

340
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,837
Is this where I ask you,
what do you have planned?

341
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,911
Why does anyone want
to be President?

342
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,252
Everybody wants to rule the world.

343
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,463
<i>All squads,
gear up and clear the L.Z.</i>

344
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,356
Prepare for extraction.

345
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,135
Extraction?
What are we, teeth?

346
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,978
- Reach H.Q.?
- No, I got nothing.

347
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,981
- Go up high.
- Roger, Sarge.

348
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,979
Block.

349
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,203
All our men accounted for.
Not a single drop of blood.

350
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,412
- Boots to asses.
- Yes, sir.

351
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,247
Except for that...
Did you scrape your elbow?

352
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,151
- No, it's red sweat.
- Yup.

353
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,196
That better have been
on somebody's face.

354
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,127
Hey, Duke.

355
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,668
You see that?

356
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,220
Security's early.

357
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,189
- Get down!
- Take cover!

358
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,933
Take cover!

359
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,929
To your weapons! Let's go!

360
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,690
On the ground!
On the ground!

361
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,117
Mouse!

362
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:08,965
Get 'em out of the L.Z.!

363
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,049
JOE 1; Medic!

364
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,497
Go!

365
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,809
Flint's down! Flint's down!

366
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,212
- I'm going for him!
- Go!

367
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,893
Ten o'clock!

368
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,899
Get down!

369
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,494
Troops in contact!
Request immediate air support!

370
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,455
I repeat, immediate air support!

371
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,860
You all right'? Come on, we got to move!
Go, go, go!

372
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,780
Help me!

373
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,408
You good? You hit?

374
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,915
Block, I got Flint.
We got to get to cover!

375
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,417
Come on.

376
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,258
Incoming! Incoming!
Go, go, go, go, go!

377
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,557
<i>Duke, come in.</i>

378
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,642
Duke!

379
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,690
Duke!

380
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,026
Get to cover, now!

381
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,275
Go!

382
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,992
- Pull back! Rally point!
- Let's go!

383
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,177
Get to the well! Go!

384
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,929
Clear 'em out of there.

385
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,422
Fall back! Fall back!

386
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,656
We're clear.

387
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,338
Let's go!

388
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:11,139
<i>We have met the enemy</i>

389
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,223
<i>and he is us.</i>

390
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:20,156
<i>Today, the world's elite
fighting force, the G. I. Joes,</i>

391
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,651
<i>abandoned their duty</i>

392
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,320
<i>and broke the sacred bond
that exists between</i>

393
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,000
<i>the American people</i>

394
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:34,325
<i>and those entrusted
with their security.</i>

395
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,134
Ready and step.

396
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,471
Ready and

397
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,680
step!

398
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:48,756
<i>The first domino fell with the
murder of the Pakistani president.</i>

399
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,004
The assassin,

400
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,889
<i>a Joe,</i>

401
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,725
<i>call sign</i>

402
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,095
<i>Snake Eyes.</i>

403
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,272
<i>But he didn't act alone.</i>

404
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,202
<i>The Joes intended to
use this situation</i>

405
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,872
<i>to seize Pakistan's
nuclear arsenal.</i>

406
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,415
<i>Now this incident</i>

407
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,795
<i>serves as a sobering reminder
of the scourge of nuclear weapons</i>

408
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,797
And to that end,

409
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,508
I call upon my fellow world leaders

410
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:24,011
to convene immediately to discuss

411
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,585
nuclear disarmament.

412
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,042
On three.

413
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,811
One.

414
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,312
Two.

415
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,839
Three!

416
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,900
The G. I. Joes

417
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,112
<i>clearly went beyond
the boundaries of their mission.</i>

418
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,488
<i>On my orders</i>

419
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:46,033
<i>a covert Special Forces unit
code named Cobra</i>

420
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:50,735
<i>terminated with extreme prejudice
Joe Command,</i>

421
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,282
<i>facilities, personnel.</i>

422
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:01,625
The G.l. Joes are no more.

423
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,371
We should leave.

424
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,910
There's nothing here.

425
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,226
There's nothing left here?

426
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,103
- That's not what he meant!
- These are our brothers!

427
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,630
That's not what he meant!

428
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,351
Whoever did this is
going to come back.

429
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,484
We need to move.

430
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,696
You are our leader now.

431
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,755
We head due east until we're clear.

432
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,226
We're gonna find the man
who did this to Duke

433
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,924
and our brothers.

434
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,634
And we're gonna kill him.

435
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,404
Snake Eyes.

436
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,807
Last place I thought I'd see you.

437
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,076
Warden James.
It's a pleasure.

438
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,871
I'm a very big fan.
I love the black.

439
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,819
It's very Johnny Cash.

440
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,376
Come. Welcome to Einsargen.

441
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,045
Let me tell you a little bit
about the place.

442
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,964
Listen to me.
I sound like a real-estate agent.

443
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,924
I'm not here to sell you anything.

444
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,828
Except maybe
hopelessness.

445
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,169
How was your trip?

446
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,953
The sensation that you're feeling,
your upside-down tummy?

447
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,789
It's due to our descent into
a former East German mine shaft.

448
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,125
It was the deepest they ever dug.

449
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,295
So deep in fact that
you just crossed out of Germany

450
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,539
into international territory.

451
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,871
Which allows me

452
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,712
certain jurisdictional freedoms.

453
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,310
Huh?

454
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,054
One word,

455
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,558
awesome.
This room is awesome!

456
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,478
Temperatures here
exceed 210 degrees

457
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:54,391
when not artificially
cooled to a crisp 68.

458
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,310
Almost calls for a Snuggle.

459
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,239
Wait till you see this next one.

460
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,915
See what I mean?
This just slays me.

461
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:15,082
It's so interesting.
This is where science has come.

462
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,930
Did you know that during REM sleep,

463
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,083
the human body

464
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,935
produces a neural chemical

465
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,770
which paralyses
every muscle in the body

466
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,856
but the heart and the eyes?
This prevents us

467
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,930
from acting out our dreams.

468
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:33,017
We have injected both of these men

469
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,185
with a synthetic version.

470
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,116
They're perfectly awake.
They're conscious,

471
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,270
they're aware of everything
that's going on around them.

472
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,441
It's just that they're
trapped inside themselves.

473
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:50,621
Well, I believe you know
your new neighbours, Destro,

474
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,337
Cobra Commander.

475
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,935
Oh, the three of you are like
my fantasy football team.

476
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,428
Gentlemen.

477
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,904
Now as your eyes and mind

478
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:20,242
travel to where you cannot,
I want you to agonise.

479
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,244
I want you to pine.

480
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:26,491
I want you to ache for what once
was and will never be again.

481
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,490
I want you to doubt that there
was ever a word for escape.

482
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,657
Welcome to hell.

483
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,499
You have no idea.

484
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,330
Snake Eyes speaks.

485
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,350
It never occurred to me
what you might sound like.

486
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,504
But I've always thought about
what you might look like.

487
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,681
We'll have that mask.

488
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,194
Storm Shadow.

489
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,365
So you killed
the Pakistani president.

490
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,129
Well, you're not exactly
my first-round draft pick,

491
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,532
but I've always been a fan.

492
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,722
Protocol says we make
a distress call, right?

493
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,600
No.
Protocol died with the unit.

494
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,851
What?

495
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,311
How's anybody gonna
know we're alive?

496
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,804
The 're not,
'cause we're not.

497
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,856
To our government,

498
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,110
to our families,
but especially to our enemy,

499
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,279
we were KIA at 0600 hours
in the Indus Valley Desert.

500
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,448
But we have to at least try.
I mean, there might be...

501
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,284
No. Anything we do now
is a rumour of a rumour.

502
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,536
Any and all traces

503
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,735
of our existence is terminated.

504
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,026
The only one I trust out there
is Snake Eyes.

505
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,155
When we got hit,

506
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,532
how we got hit,

507
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,167
we were set up right
from the start.

508
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,261
How many <i>stars</i> would
someone need on their shoulder

509
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,722
to call an attack like that?
Four? Five?

510
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,725
No, not stars. Buttons on his suit.

511
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,602
National Security Adviser.
Secretary of Defence.

512
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:14,303
No. There's only one man who could
authorise a strike like that.

513
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,806
And I voted for him.

514
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,230
All vitals
on Cobra Commander are steady.

515
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,412
Storm Shadow
nerve prohibitors injected.

516
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,000
Sixty-two degrees
on a change of 4%.

517
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,770
Aerial threat! Down!

518
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,839
We're going home.

519
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,368
Full arrest! Full arrest!

520
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,219
No drill! Bring the restraints!

521
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,963
Remove the containment lid!

522
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,091
Where's the serum? Quickly!

523
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,895
Adrenaline now. Now!
Adrenaline!

524
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,469
Let's go! Quickly, quickly!

525
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,766
Move! Move!

526
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,513
Where's the serum?

527
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,901
Let's go!

528
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,537
Peel back! Move!

529
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,456
What do you mean,
his heart stopped beating?

530
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,451
No one here dies unless I say so!

531
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,169
Oh, my God.

532
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,571
Fire!

533
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,288
Fire! Fire!

534
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,679
Take him down!

535
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,457
Take him down!

536
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,542
Clear on the north!

537
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,931
Clear!

538
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,484
Welcome to hell.

539
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,952
Stop!

540
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,414
You shoot anything
that walks through that door!

541
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,544
Anything!

542
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,881
Storm Shadow.

543
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,899
Never a doubt.

544
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,143
Cobra Commander.

545
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,099
Destro.

546
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,036
You're out of the band.

547
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,538
Come on.

548
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,986
Come on.

549
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,006
I see you've arranged
transportation.

550
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,697
Making more things go boom
by 9:00 a.m.

551
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,866
than most people do all day.

552
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:24,578
Firefly. Good to see
you, old friend.

553
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,151
Sir.

554
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,416
Some people
just didn't want to let me in.

555
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,753
Now, I busted out of eight prisons.

556
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,827
But I only broke into one.

557
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:40,594
All communications have been cutoff.
No one will know you're even missing.

558
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,739
Take him
to the mountains to heal.

559
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,815
I'll need him
for the war I'm about to start.

560
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,309
I want to help you.

561
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,826
We've seen Storm's injuries.
We know where he's headed.

562
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,042
And you need me.

563
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,957
Good.

564
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:26,700
Sir, launch controls are nearly up.
The director was running behind.

565
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:31,277
Well, he ain't running behind no more.
Or anywhere else, for that matter.

566
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,708
Armour prototype
is complete to your specs.

567
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,835
I got it up to 60
on the dyno today.

568
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,837
You'll like this. Working title,

569
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,616
High Speed Sentry. HISS.

570
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,955
It's good to have you back, sir.

571
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,974
Ain't she a beauty?

572
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:55,380
Soon the world
will cower in the face of Zeus.

573
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:06,892
All we've been missing
is our Commander.

574
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,315
Cool mask.

575
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,460
Someone took his time.

576
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:21,629
Not easy to sneak out
of that big, white,

577
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,424
11-bedroom,
35-and-a-half bath...

578
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,801
Just don't forget
who put you there.

579
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,928
Or the rock you
crawled out from.

580
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,924
Firefly. It's good to know
we're not running low on crazy.

581
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,045
Still all 10 fingers?

582
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,941
How is our former President?

583
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,515
Oh, he is worth his
weight in platinum.

584
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,182
You know, they call
it a waterboard,

585
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,241
but I never get bored.

586
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:55,121
In 48 hours,
Zeus will launch.

587
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,024
Just one wrinkle.

588
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,866
Three Joes somehow survived
our little house cleaning.

589
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,297
A drone picked up voiceprints
in the Indus Valley.

590
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,466
Can I trust you with nothing?

591
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,369
They'll slip up.

592
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,212
And when they do,

593
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,840
I'll hunt 'em to ground.

594
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,919
Hoo-ah.

595
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,316
No, no, it's cool.

596
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,021
I got it.

597
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,907
You lost, little man?

598
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,402
No, I ain't lost.

599
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,670
I think you got the wrong street.

600
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,672
So why don't you take Miley Cyrus

601
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,746
and Ryan Seacrest

602
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,244
and head back that way?

603
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,088
I'm going that way.

604
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,433
Oh, yeah?

605
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,960
Yeah.

606
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,922
Go ahead, Marvin.

607
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,721
Man, don't call me that name.

608
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,693
What's up? Little Marvin!

609
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,194
- Marvin?
- Big Marvin now.

610
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,946
Had you worried for a minute, man.

611
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,824
Watch your hand back there, boy.
You don't want them to get you.

612
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,284
Look at you. You got grown.

613
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,369
How your parents
make a kid this big, man?

614
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,580
- "His parents are like 5'2" apiece.
- Really?

615
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,415
You're taking
that P90X serious, huh?

616
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,666
Twice a week.

617
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,115
I see. Look at the
size of your neck.

618
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,379
Let me introduce you.
This is Flint.

619
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,827
What up?

620
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,132
Lady Jaye.

621
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,625
Lady Jaye. Hey.

622
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,552
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

623
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,596
It's what happens when you're
in trouble, you come home.

624
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:35,847
Home is where the help is.

625
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,249
Amen.

626
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,933
Well, we got you.

627
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,560
Set up at the rec centre.

628
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:43,214
Lay low over there.
Nobody gonna bother you.

629
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,387
As far as wheels go,

630
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,525
I'm gonna let you roll my truck.

631
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,973
Thank you.

632
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,862
I got payments on that truck, man.

633
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,906
I don't get it like I used to.
All right?

634
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,308
Thank you, Stoop.

635
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,651
I owe you one, brother.

636
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,651
Actually, you owe me two.

637
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,649
That other one don't count.

638
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,409
Welcome home, Marvin.

639
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,593
Watch your step.

640
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:17,214
No one's been here for years.
This is gonna have to be our pit for now.

641
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:25,389
Wow. It's an actual pit.

642
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,179
It's my old stomping ground.

643
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,861
Are you sure
we can trust this Stoop guy?

644
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,764
Stoop's no angel.

645
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,266
But he is family and
we can trust him.

646
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,290
Can we be traced?

647
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,209
We can mask our IP addresses.

648
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,878
I'll cyber-blast an encoded beacon
every six hours.

649
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,380
If any Joes did survive,

650
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,714
we need to let them know
where we're at.

651
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,174
All right. Well, let's get to work.

652
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,468
Flint, inventory every piece
of equipment we got left.

653
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,679
Jaye, start that database
on our President.

654
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,473
We'll find out what's going on
with our Commander-in-Chief.

655
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,726
He's not acting like the man we know.
We find out why,

656
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,300
we can start being soldiers again.

657
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:07,040
<i>Lieutenant Lady Jaye,
requesting immediate aid.</i>

658
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,541
<i>If any Joes have survived</i>

659
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,365
This channel's restricted to Joes,
isn't it?

660
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,546
<i>...magnetic west of the Potomac.</i>

661
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,881
They're alive.

662
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:17,785
<i>This is Lieutenant Lady Jaye
requesting immediate aid.</i>

663
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,262
<i>Lieutenant Lady Jaye,
this is Jinx and Snake Eyes.</i>

664
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,540
<i>We are in pursuit of Storm Shadow.</i>

665
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,771
Even if Snake Eyes and Jinx
grab Storm,

666
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:32,049
they're still halfway
around the world.

667
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,977
We're on our own.

668
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,481
Enough for a battle.

669
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,521
Not a war.

670
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,144
We're fighting uphill here.

671
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,325
I came here when I was 14
with a life expectancy of 13.

672
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,579
I was bounced around
from home to home, until this

673
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,465
became my home.

674
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,834
Guys were lined up
outside that door to fight me.

675
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:04,256
They whooped my skinny ass so much
I started to enjoy it.

676
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,923
Till one winter,

677
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:09,678
I grew 8 inches and
gained 60 pounds.

678
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:14,357
I punched a guy so hard he
couldn't move his arm to tap out.

679
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,818
Then when the Joes
came recruiting to the hood,

680
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,187
I'd already beaten down half of it.

681
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:24,068
I became a Joe to serve.
In the field.

682
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:28,273
So if we're fighting uphill,
we take the hill.

683
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,197
Hey, I got something
you'll want to see.

684
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,872
During my check of the President,
look what I found.

685
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,875
This is the President
on August 9th.

686
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,135
<i>...an addiction
to offshore energy,</i>

687
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,096
<i>where we 're forced to be
kind of embroiled</i>

688
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:47,140
<i>in the affairs of foreign nations.</i>

689
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,350
And this is 10 days later.

690
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,424
<i>I mean, otherwise, we're sort of-</i>

691
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:56,441
These are conversational fillers.
Little phrases

692
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,401
we spit out to give our brain
a chance to catch up

693
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,944
with our mouth. Like...

694
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,529
- Like.
- Yes.

695
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,114
And our President?

696
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:05,450
Between August 9th and August 19th,

697
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:07,034
he stopped using
"you know" and "kind of"

698
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,537
and started using
"I mean" and "sort of."

699
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,956
But that's not all.
"Supper" became "dinner."

700
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,574
"Soda" became "pop."

701
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,669
One President, two fingerprints.

702
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,629
But it's a few words, right?
I mean, how much can...

703
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,077
Check this out.

704
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,078
Two press conferences,
July 31st, September 1st.

705
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,913
See his fingers clasped?

706
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,390
Left thumb on top
versus right thumb on top.

707
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,267
The same person
never does this differently,

708
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,920
it feels wrong.

709
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,925
What if the President

710
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,360
isn't the President?

711
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:45,607
Look, if the Commander-in-Chief
is an imposter

712
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,868
and he's the one that
ordered the attack,

713
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,943
we have to assume
that there's no one we can trust.

714
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,611
There is one man.

715
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,863
He's the reason we
call ourselves Joes.

716
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,310
Hello?

717
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:46,706
I'll take two cases of Thin Mints
and a box of Chuckle Lucks.

718
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:49,042
Lower your weapons.

719
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,383
General Colton, if I may...

720
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,044
Shut your mouth, Brenda.

721
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,312
My name's not Brenda.

722
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,981
How'd you get in?

723
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,983
Sir, apologies.

724
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,485
- Sergeant Marvin...
- I know who you are.

725
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,308
Then you know why I'm here.

726
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,906
<i>It's not like
I don't hear what you're saying.</i>

727
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,734
But an imposter President?

728
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,907
How come when the General says it,
it sounds crazy?

729
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,218
What'd they do with
the real President?

730
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,962
We fear he's dead.

731
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:35,171
I don't think so.
You're not going to kill your best asset.

732
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,429
"Conrad Hauser. Duke."

733
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,432
Your captain.

734
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,688
Tell me one thing
you know about him.

735
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,690
Great soldier.

736
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,603
Better friend.

737
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,439
And he saved my life, sir.

738
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,531
Good.

739
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,704
What you're proposing is treason.

740
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,301
I'm gonna need something
a little more to go on

741
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,204
than overlapping thumbs.

742
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,557
Before you retired,
you served on a security commission

743
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,726
with the President's
Chief of Staff.

744
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,970
General Colton,
can you get us close?

745
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,551
Negative.

746
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,651
I can't scratch my ass in this town
without getting on the watch list.

747
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,895
Brenda, hand me that pen.

748
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,728
Girl Scout to secretary.

749
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:36,068
Amazing. Name's not Brenda.

750
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,902
It's just a pen.

751
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,785
Avenue K, Georgetown. 9:00 p.m.

752
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,239
There's a poker game
with the Chief of Staff there.

753
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,340
He's not a good poker player.

754
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,084
He's got 1,000 tells.

755
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,756
We only need one.

756
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,102
Hey, hon.

757
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:04,427
Just got out of poker.
Poorer but wiser.

758
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,941
It was a good day,
actually.

759
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,765
The Prez was taking
his crazy pills again.

760
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:14,532
Baby, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

761
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:15,866
Yeah.

762
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,610
Love you.

763
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,208
Excuse me.

764
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,418
Oh, hi.

765
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,877
Hi.

766
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,121
You need a hand with your bags?

767
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:30,953
Sure.

768
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,592
No problem.
There you go.

769
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,994
Thank you.

770
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,221
Who said chivalry
is dead, right?

771
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,556
Chivalry.

772
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,892
Talk like that,
I'm gonna get myself in trouble.

773
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,102
Where we heading?

774
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,550
Just right around the corner.

775
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,781
That tingly feeling is amobarbital.

776
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,560
It's a sedative that causes
anterograde amnesia.

777
00:58:58,577 --> 00:58:59,952
In five minutes, you're
gonna be asleep.

778
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,902
In another five, you're gonna wake
up with no idea I ever existed.

779
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,114
Notice anything strange
about your boss?

780
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,634
Maybe. Why?

781
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:18,584
'Cause you're gonna make
a phone call for us. Get us close to him.

782
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,681
But don't worry.
You're gonna forget everything,

783
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,210
so your conscience will be clear.

784
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:25,853
Why are you doing this?

785
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:28,348
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

786
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,010
Make the call.

787
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,435
Oh!

788
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:10,745
Thank God.

789
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:23,090
El Presidente <i>is on a roll.</i>

790
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,683
<i>His numbers are up.</i>

791
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,185
<i>And I'm not just
talking about his age.</i>

792
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,766
<i>Now, I'm not gonna call
our Commander-in-Chief old.</i>

793
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:34,985
<i>Actually, he called me the
other day for some advice.</i>

794
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,987
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

795
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:39,823
<i>He wanted to hook up
the nation's nuclear arsenal</i>

796
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:40,949
<i>to the Clapper.</i>

797
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,164
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're...

798
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,874
Late, I know.

799
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,118
Imagine the army it takes
to make me look like this.

800
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:55,047
Forgive me. That's an army
I'd like to enlist in.

801
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:57,049
Speaking of lists,

802
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,919
would you like to explain
why you're not on ours?

803
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,796
Here she is. Chief of Staff.

804
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,584
Enjoy your evening,
Miss Vandervoort.

805
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,399
I'm in.

806
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,643
Roger that. Standing by.

807
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,679
Jaye?

808
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:21,698
You keep your head down. Be safe.

809
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,241
<i>Mr Carville was
nice enough to mention</i>

810
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:26,536
<i>one of my passions.
Nuclear disarmament.</i>

811
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,996
<i>In just days,</i>

812
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,946
<i>the leaders of the world's
eight nuclear nations</i>

813
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,752
<i>will gather at historic Fort Sumter</i>

814
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:36,155
<i>for a nuclear summit.</i>

815
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,759
<i>But before the Atomic Eight
break bread,</i>

816
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,332
<i>it's our turn.</i>

817
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:45,127
Thank you, James.
Thank you so much.

818
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,729
Mr President.
Amy Vandervoort, Fox News.

819
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,023
Oh, Fox, of course.

820
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,442
That's why you look so
"fair and balanced."

821
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:01,321
Very cute. But I was
actually hoping to have a...

822
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,447
Dance?

823
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,366
- I was going to say, quote.
- Ah.

824
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:05,784
<i>Okay, here's a quote.</i>

825
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:08,704
<i>The world will change
after my nuclear summit.</i>

826
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,698
<i>How about we dance?</i>

827
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:14,155
<i>I really, I don't dance.</i>

828
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,153
Sorry.

829
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,797
<i>Thank you, Mr President.
You gave me what I need.</i>

830
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:21,200
<i>But I really have to
make my deadline.</i>

831
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,544
- It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.

832
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,850
How are you?

833
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:31,377
Good, sir.

834
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:43,530
<i>I got a strand of hair from his jacket.
I hope it's enough.</i>

835
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:45,115
Come on.

836
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,575
<i>Copy that.</i>

837
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,023
Standing by for I.D.

838
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:59,239
All units, setting condition orange.
Stand by.

839
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:02,955
I don't take
no for an answer.

840
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,008
Almost there.

841
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,503
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

842
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:18,257
Zartan?

843
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:21,860
Jaye, get out of there now.

844
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:23,695
Oh, my God.

845
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,239
We have an unauthorised I.D.
She's a Joe.

846
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,734
We have a Joe on the premises.

847
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,651
Jaye.

848
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,617
Jaye, now.

849
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,260
I'm out.

850
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,845
<i>Plan B, rendezvous Bravo.</i>

851
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:50,806
Negative.
Proceed to rendezvous Charlie.

852
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,208
<i>Charlie.</i>

853
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,509
What's that supposed to mean?

854
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,050
Sorry, Jaye.

855
01:11:58,439 --> 01:11:59,840
I got it from here.

856
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,149
Don't.

857
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:04,069
<i>We have proof.
We're taking it to Joe Colton.</i>

858
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,737
You planned this all along.

859
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,405
<i>Block, stand down.</i>

860
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:10,150
We ain't lawyers. We're soldiers.

861
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,941
I told you I was gonna
find the man who did this.

862
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,163
I was gonna kill him.

863
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,623
No! That's... No. Negative!

864
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,697
Block. Block.

865
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:23,113
Damn it!

866
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,543
One in the chamber.

867
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,098
Block? Block, where are you?

868
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:35,444
I want to see that face.

869
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,694
The one where you realise
today's the day.

870
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,500
It's the face all those pretty
little Joes had in the desert

871
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,336
when I lit them all
up like fireworks!

872
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,345
I really want to see that face.

873
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,692
There it is.

874
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:43,395
If Cobra and Zartan
are in the White House,

875
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,469
then the world is at stake.

876
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,065
Storm Shadow.

877
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,810
You will tell us Cobra's endgame,

878
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:52,070
or die

879
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:56,692
by the same sword you once
used to kill our master.

880
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,189
Your sword,

881
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:03,444
given to you
by our beloved Hard Master.

882
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,824
Do you deny that your envy
and hatred drove you to shed

883
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:10,326
the Hard Master's blood?

884
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:15,207
<i>It's possible
to feel so much hate</i>

885
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:18,005
you stop feeling it at all.

886
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:21,801
Like a fish not knowing
it's in water.

887
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,635
But my path was chosen for me

888
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,342
by my enemy

889
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:33,179
who framed me
for killing the Hard Master.

890
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,313
And my friends

891
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,313
who believed it.

892
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:50,454
Why defend yourself to men
too blind to see?

893
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,417
That is the Hard Master's blood.

894
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,713
But that is not...

895
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,797
Wait!

896
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,216
...my sword.

897
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,649
Arashikage steel does not break.

898
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,566
I have asked myself over and over

899
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:32,329
who despised me enough
to destroy my life?

900
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,954
I am sorry,
Storm Shadow.

901
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:39,711
But who would stand to gain the
most by framing you for this crime?

902
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,756
Your young adversary
who chased you away?

903
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:56,179
Or the man into whose arms
you were chased.

904
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,766
<i>Someone who welcomed you,</i>

905
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:03,310
<i>showed you kindness.</i>

906
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,233
He needed me.

907
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,439
For who I would become.

908
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:12,365
A warrior of great skill and anger.

909
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:18,625
<i>The man who betrayed me
was capable of great ingenuity,</i>

910
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:23,080
violence,

911
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,593
<i>but most of all,</i>

912
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,589
disguise.

913
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:36,761
Zartan.

914
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:38,849
Yes.

915
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:43,158
<i>Tell us what he and
Cobra have planned</i>

916
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:46,403
<i>so we can destroy our common enemy</i>

917
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,405
together.

918
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,320
Try to hold still.

919
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,788
You want to remind me how knuckles
are supposed to strike again?

920
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:01,577
Together.

921
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:03,720
Those were your words.

922
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:06,306
- I had a shot and I took it.
- Now, don't give me that!

923
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:07,390
You went rogue.

924
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:08,433
And I'd do it again.

925
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,852
Yeah? And what was
your big plan, then, huh?

926
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,687
You get yourself killed?

927
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:17,685
Jesus Christ. I listened to everything
you said over and over again.

928
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:19,235
I never questioned...

929
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:21,764
I wasn't going to
bury any more Joes.

930
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:31,819
I've got guns to clean.

931
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:50,709
Hey.

932
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,337
Help me out here?

933
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,557
Thanks.

934
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,423
If my dad could see me now...

935
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,326
What are you talking about?

936
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,337
He wouldn't believe it.

937
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,418
Why?

938
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,686
Third generation military.

939
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:37,590
Desperately wanted a fourth, and

940
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:39,804
<i>my mom had me.</i>

941
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:47,107
Well, he must be
real proud of you, then.

942
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,772
He didn't believe
in female soldiers.

943
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:53,113
I finally asked him why. He said

944
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,610
he didn't want to put his life
in the hands of a woman.

945
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,871
I enlisted the next day.

946
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,550
Spent the next seven years

947
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:08,921
trying to outrank him
so he'd have to salute me.

948
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,582
Did it work?

949
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:23,385
He died before I got the chance.

950
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,646
I'm sorry.

951
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,159
I'm actually gonna miss the red.

952
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:50,875
You look real nice.

953
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:56,293
Hey. I said we got guns to clean.

954
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,928
The world ain't saving itself.

955
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,608
That was for the tax hike.

956
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,932
Like you pay taxes.

957
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,346
Ain't always about me.

958
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,974
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

959
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,107
We still need the man.

960
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:18,274
Besides, we've grown close.

961
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,626
Is Storm Shadow in?

962
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:25,952
Don't you worry about him.
He'll be more than ready.

963
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:28,659
I'm not too impressed
with your Cabinet.

964
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,413
No confirmation
hearings, that's what you get.

965
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,306
Enough!

966
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:37,630
I'll take it from here.

967
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:41,562
He who controls this briefcase,

968
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,315
controls the U.S. nuclear arsenal

969
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,309
and the fate of humanity.

970
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:49,975
Open your eyes, Mr Ex-President.

971
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:53,855
The eyes are
the windows to the soul.

972
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:57,703
Open up-

973
01:21:57,704 --> 01:21:59,447
Zeus is ready.

974
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:04,616
We just need
one final piece of the puzzle.

975
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,949
Well done.

976
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,082
History will stand in judgment.

977
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,513
Not of me. Of you.

978
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,839
What do we got, Jaye?

979
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,442
Zartan's entire focus
has been this nuclear summit.

980
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:29,193
It has to be the key
to whatever he's planning.

981
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,767
All right. Well, then
that's our target.

982
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,602
Yeah.

983
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,773
Guys, move.

984
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:01,175
I think I'm faster
than you, Snake Eyes.

985
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,607
Damn Ninjas.

986
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,306
Good to see you, brother.

987
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,892
Jaye.

988
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:14,472
Jinx.

989
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,152
Back up.

990
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,647
He's with us.

991
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:25,708
I am not with you.

992
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:27,782
But for this once,

993
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:29,504
I am not against you.

994
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,452
How many of our men has he killed?

995
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:33,621
We're supposed to fight with him?

996
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:41,641
The leaders of the world
will gather tomorrow. It's a trap.

997
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:43,809
Storm is the only one
who knows Cobra's plan

998
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,679
inside and out. He can help
us find a way to stop it.

999
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:49,174
But we have to work together.

1000
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,434
All right

1001
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:58,270
Let's move.

1002
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,873
Merry Christmas.

1003
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,877
Makes you wonder
about your neighbours.

1004
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:31,887
Nice.

1005
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:44,024
Open up that couch.

1006
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,204
Anything?

1007
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,491
I brought my own.

1008
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,752
Nice.

1009
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,022
Yeah, that'll work.

1010
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,692
Hey.

1011
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:25,858
That one's mine.

1012
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:28,865
This really is Patton's
gun, isn't it?

1013
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,113
Gift from his family.

1014
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,285
What an honour.

1015
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:35,204
You bet.

1016
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:40,543
I was actually thinking about
something a little more your size.

1017
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:47,550
Try not to scratch her up.

1018
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,379
Idles a little rough in neutral.

1019
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:55,308
I ain't gonna be in neutral.

1020
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:57,394
Hoo-ah.

1021
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:59,683
What about you?

1022
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:04,689
DOD says
I can't come out of retirement.

1023
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:11,236
They didn't say anything
about reenlisting.

1024
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:16,909
Reporting for duty, Sergeant Major.

1025
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:19,658
I'd like to bring a
couple friends of mine.

1026
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,593
Colton's team,
it's our honour.

1027
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:23,719
You guys take the perimeter.

1028
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,088
Flint, Jaye, Snake,
you guys take the flank.

1029
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,925
Jinx and Storm, Trojan Horse.

1030
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:31,102
Zartan will be holding
the briefcase.

1031
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:32,937
Storm will be the
closest man to him.

1032
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:35,773
But he can't move
until we're all in position.

1033
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:37,566
Everyone keep your
eye on the prize.

1034
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:40,311
We secure the football,
we secure the world.

1035
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:42,939
Snake, how's all that sound?

1036
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,156
That's what I thought.

1037
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,366
Okay, wait.
Hold on a second.

1038
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:49,245
We still have enemy armour
here, here, and here.

1039
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:50,818
Right?

1040
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:54,117
These tanks survive, we don't.

1041
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,533
Leave the tanks to me.

1042
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:58,879
General?

1043
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,372
Call me Joe.

1044
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,299
- Anything I missed?
- No.

1045
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,544
Rock solid. My orders?

1046
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,038
The President.

1047
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:10,875
- Brenda's with my team.
- Roger that.

1048
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,712
Does Brenda get a vote?

1049
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:16,052
Negative

1050
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,723
You need a pen?

1051
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:19,888
I need your help.

1052
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,903
All right

1053
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:24,739
Let's kick that ass! Hoo-ah!

1054
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,232
Hoo-ah!

1055
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,910
<i>A historic day for</i>

1056
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:32,037
<i>the President of the United States
as he meets with...</i>

1057
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:34,457
<i>This afternoon, the
President is meeting with the leaders</i>

1058
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:35,958
<i>of the eight nuclear powers.</i>

1059
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,960
<i>Never before
has a President been so bold</i>

1060
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,296
<i>to call the leaders
of the world together...</i>

1061
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:42,089
<i>These are
unprecedented nuclear talks</i>

1062
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,591
<i>that most believed
would never happen.</i>

1063
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:46,510
<i>You can bet security is
at its highest...</i>

1064
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,345
<i>We may be closer
to a nuclear-free world</i>

1065
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:50,306
<i>than</i> we have ever been.

1066
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:51,599
<i>My fellow world leaders,</i>

1067
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,753
<i>welcome to the hallowed grounds
of Fort Sumter,</i>

1068
01:27:54,811 --> 01:28:00,433
whose proud walls saw the first shots
in our nation's grievous Civil War.

1069
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:05,029
<i>Here, men rushed through the breach
in a madness.</i>

1070
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:08,866
<i>What better place to step back
from that same breach.</i>

1071
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:11,440
<i>Renounce our darker natures.</i>

1072
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:14,781
<i>Forgive our staunchest foes.</i>

1073
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:19,861
This site is symbolic.

1074
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,119
Not only for the peace
we seek to achieve,

1075
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:27,749
<i>but the conﬂagration
we seek to avoid.</i>

1076
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:31,680
<i>The Cobras who protect us today</i>

1077
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:35,392
<i>are dedicated to the belief
that there is no greater peace</i>

1078
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,295
<i>than peace of mind.</i>

1079
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,898
Thank you.

1080
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,483
I'll say it again.

1081
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:45,637
The world is safer
with a nuclear presence.

1082
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:49,228
I'm sure your electorate will
be happy by our final proposal.

1083
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:52,986
50% reduction by 2016.

1084
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,986
There are a lot of
leaders in this room.

1085
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:02,071
But only one leader
of the free world.

1086
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,913
And he,

1087
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,745
I, stay with me,

1088
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:12,339
asked you here with the goal
of universal disarmament.

1089
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,956
Nuclear zero.

1090
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:18,921
Now, I was prepared
to cajole to get what I want.

1091
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:21,089
I'm now at threaten.

1092
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:26,485
Each of you will clear out
his nuclear closet immediately.

1093
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:31,107
Failure to participate
will be considered an act of war.

1094
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:32,950
You're joking, of course.

1095
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,535
This summit is over.

1096
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:36,028
Then this is it.

1097
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,693
This is it, boys.

1098
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:42,084
This country is at war.

1099
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:46,535
With you and you and you
and you and you and you.

1100
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:59,465
<i>Delta team in position.
Echo, you're a go.</i>

1101
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:02,263
<i>This is Echo.
Beginning assault.</i>

1102
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:06,942
The U.S. nuclear arsenal

1103
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:11,447
is capable of destroying each of
your countries 14 times over.

1104
01:30:11,448 --> 01:30:14,897
Fifteen, in the case of North Korea,
just to be sure.

1105
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:17,069
And all

1106
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:21,324
at the push

1107
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,780
of a button.

1108
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:39,834
It's true. Yeah!

1109
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:41,518
Yeah, I pressed it.

1110
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,045
You have lost your mind!

1111
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,469
It's all relative.

1112
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,944
You got three minutes to decide.

1113
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:52,814
- You got next watch?
- Maintain radio silence.

1114
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:14,760
We cannot, we will not leave
a legacy of acquiescence!

1115
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:16,708
Bring the briefcase.

1116
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:25,980
Don't do this!

1117
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,803
There can be no winners!

1118
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:33,404
Ooh. High score.

1119
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:38,311
Let history record who was
responsible for this madness.

1120
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:43,568
Launch.

1121
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,635
Launch.

1122
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:24,371
Eyes on the Emerald City.

1123
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:27,696
<i>Jaye and Colton,
you're a go for POTUS.</i>

1124
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,313
You all right?

1125
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:51,557
Yeah. You all right?

1126
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:54,393
My cholesterol's a little high.

1127
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:58,727
<i>Jaye and General Colton.
Checkpoint neutralised.</i>

1128
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:00,733
You're on your own.

1129
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:16,575
Well, the good news is, no global
warming summit next month.

1130
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:19,176
Unless

1131
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:22,679
one of us cared enough
about his place in history

1132
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,557
to unilaterally
disable his warheads.

1133
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:26,934
Hmm?

1134
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,678
You know, in the name
of the children.

1135
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:30,687
Any volunteers?

1136
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:32,648
No? Fine.

1137
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:34,266
Me.

1138
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:49,206
Call your people to confirm.

1139
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:51,208
You're a complete lunatic.

1140
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:53,752
Says the man about to destroy Asia.

1141
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:55,379
Come on,
who's going to follow suit, huh?

1142
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:59,049
Are you really going to stand by
and watch <i>as</i> Earth is destroyed?

1143
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,622
Abort!

1144
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:18,636
I figured North Korea for last.

1145
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:23,266
Got to love the little guy.

1146
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:25,200
Gentlemen.

1147
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:28,229
Welcome to a nuclear-free world.

1148
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:35,157
I want to direct your attention
to live images of your homelands.

1149
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:45,929
Now, you're looking
at an advanced weapons system

1150
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,003
we call Project Zeus.

1151
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:52,720
There are seven Zeus satellites
orbiting Earth.

1152
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:56,648
<i>Each satellite contains
10 hollow platinum tubes</i>

1153
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:59,051
<i>filled with a tungsten rod.</i>

1154
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:02,529
Zeus satellite 1-A
approaching London.

1155
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:06,434
Ordnance live and loaded.
Awaiting drop authorisation.

1156
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:11,163
Now, to direct a rod to its target,
we don't launch it or fire it.

1157
01:35:11,164 --> 01:35:12,611
We drop it!

1158
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:20,285
Gravity does the rest.

1159
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:24,043
Observe.

1160
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:29,640
Satellite 1-A. We have
remote launch authorisation.

1161
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:31,850
Three, two, one,

1162
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:33,343
drop.

1163
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:42,653
A rod touches down
eight times faster than a bullet.

1164
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:46,558
And with a force significantly
greater than a nuclear warhead.

1165
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:50,899
None of the fallout.

1166
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:53,444
All of the fun.

1167
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,048
You will have to
answer for this.

1168
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:20,891
To your Congress, your courts.

1169
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:24,569
Correction,
they will have to answer to me.

1170
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,813
What is it you want?

1171
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:31,560
I want it all.

1172
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:56,586
The Cobra revolution has begun.

1173
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:02,267
By pressing that button, Zartan
initiated an auto-drop sequence.

1174
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:05,819
My Zeus satellites
are moving into position

1175
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:08,018
over your six remaining countries.

1176
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:11,184
Satellites 2-A through 7-A
en route to targets.

1177
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:14,770
The same button that begins this
can end it.

1178
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:17,440
But I only press it for a price.

1179
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:20,785
Total allegiance.

1180
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:32,835
<i>Block, secure the perimeter!</i>

1181
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:54,440
Get the control case from Zartan.
I'm going to drop them all.

1182
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:59,406
Head to the door! Go, go, go!

1183
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:31,822
Satellites en route to targets.

1184
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:34,225
Beginning command protocols.

1185
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:20,779
Follow that ground team! Go!

1186
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:23,941
Stay.

1187
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:40,837
<i>On your six, Cobra two!</i>

1188
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,599
Cobra one, Cobra one,
I need eyes on! Eyes on!

1189
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:10,947
Damn it.

1190
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:19,387
<i>We've got her cornered.</i>

1191
01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:21,506
<i>She ain't going anywhere.</i>

1192
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:49,234
Go!

1193
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:16,778
Storm.
I never figured you for a Joe.

1194
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:19,227
I'm very disappointed in you.

1195
01:41:36,716 --> 01:41:38,413
You're a bitch to hit.

1196
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:34,798
Traitor.

1197
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:40,429
Storm.

1198
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:43,740
You know, this sword
was never intended

1199
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:46,610
for anyone
with anger management issues.

1200
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:03,331
Boom!

1201
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,676
- What was that?
- Shut up.

1202
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:22,112
- Ray?
- Yes, sir.

1203
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:23,697
Check the door. Give me a sit rep.

1204
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:25,145
I'm on it.

1205
01:43:40,005 --> 01:43:41,782
You two secure the entrance.

1206
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:05,890
- What are you doing'?
- Let's go. We're out of here.

1207
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:08,984
Stand down. I'm gonna shoot him!

1208
01:44:09,577 --> 01:44:11,479
I said stand down!

1209
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:16,541
Be a good G.l. Joe and drop the gun.
We're walking out of here.

1210
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:18,251
I will shoot him in the head.
Do you understand me?

1211
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:20,170
You're not listening, are you?
Put the gun down!

1212
01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:21,663
Drop it!

1213
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:31,673
Easy, easy.

1214
01:44:32,183 --> 01:44:33,808
Put some pressure on it.

1215
01:44:33,809 --> 01:44:35,560
General Colton.

1216
01:44:35,561 --> 01:44:37,353
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1217
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:39,606
- Sorry, Mr President.
- No, it's fine.

1218
01:44:39,607 --> 01:44:41,191
Come on. Let's move.

1219
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:42,639
Here we go.

1220
01:44:42,735 --> 01:44:45,604
Roadblock, POTUS secure.
No casualties.

1221
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:49,266
<i>Roger that, Jaye.</i>

1222
01:44:56,665 --> 01:44:59,067
You betrayed the Hard Master.

1223
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:03,413
And made me what I am.

1224
01:45:03,422 --> 01:45:04,923
Yep.

1225
01:45:04,924 --> 01:45:06,951
Yeah, I can see that was wrong.

1226
01:45:31,617 --> 01:45:34,896
<i>We need eyes
on Firefly and Cobra ASAP.</i>

1227
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:48,830
Courtyard clear.
No sign of him.

1228
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:54,623
Commander,
I have the case.

1229
01:45:55,015 --> 01:45:56,432
<i>We are still a go.</i>

1230
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:58,176
How long till drop?

1231
01:45:58,394 --> 01:46:01,437
On schedule, Commander.
Five minutes to live fire.

1232
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:02,605
Final targeting to begin shortly.

1233
01:46:02,606 --> 01:46:05,850
Zeus satellites 4
and 7 in position.

1234
01:46:09,738 --> 01:46:14,393
Zeus satellites 2, 3, 5, and 6
are locked on target. France,

1235
01:46:14,535 --> 01:46:16,312
Russia, North Korea,

1236
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:19,732
<i>India, Israel, China.</i>

1237
01:46:41,145 --> 01:46:42,546
Block.

1238
01:46:43,105 --> 01:46:44,522
<i>Cobra Commander's bugging out.</i>

1239
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:46,220
No sign of Firefly.

1240
01:46:47,276 --> 01:46:49,019
I've got him.
