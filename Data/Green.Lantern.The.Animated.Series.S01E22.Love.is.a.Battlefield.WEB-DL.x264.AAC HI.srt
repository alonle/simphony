2
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:27,215
Now let's destroy the rest of these
Manhunters and get out of here!

3
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:28,660
You will not harm them.

4
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:32,241
They function without
emotion, as I do now.

5
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:34,484
I shall be their Queen.

00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:46,902
Sisters, look!

9
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:56,731
Invasion!

10
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:11,344
Hyah! Unh!

11
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,116
Hyah!

12
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:27,700
Unh!

13
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:31,972
Manhunters here?

14
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:38,581
Hyah! Huh!

15
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:49,226
Hyah! Hyah!

16
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:52,083
No man escapes
the Manhunters.

17
00:01:52,117 --> 00:01:56,588
I am no man. I am Aga'po,
Queen of the Zamarons!

18
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:03,306
As soon as the scanners locate Aya, we'll
set a course directly for her coordinates.

19
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:06,731
- If we find her.
- What's that supposed to mean?

20
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:10,490
Hey. Look. I love your cockeyed
optimism, but she was our nav computer.

21
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,216
All the stuff we need to find her
we can't do so well without her.

22
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,295
Aya needs our help
more than ever.

23
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,288
She's confused,
and her processors are misfiring.

24
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:21,323
Confused? We wish.

25
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,194
Going off the deep end and plugging
into that invincible Antimonitor body?

26
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:27,350
We'll be probably
be saving folks <i>from</i> her.

27
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,043
Aya has helped pull our fat
from the fire plenty of times.

28
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:32,036
Now we're gonna
return the favor.

29
00:02:32,104 --> 00:02:34,305
If only we knew
where she was.

30
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:56,930
Star Sapphires of Zamaron, I demand
an audience with your Queen.

31
00:02:57,032 --> 00:03:00,360
You are the robot
that served the Green Lanterns.

32
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:02,404
Why have you come
here making war?

33
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:06,214
I have gained the understanding
that the emotion you serve, love,

34
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,444
is not only useless,
but destructive.

35
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:13,650
Love does not destroy. It sustains
and strengthens all who feel it.

36
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:15,186
That is a lie.

37
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:18,756
I loved and was loved only
to have that love retracted,

38
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,858
leaving me nothing but pain.

39
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:23,327
You, a machine?

40
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:27,698
A truly living being would trust
that love will always prevail.

41
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:32,971
Negative. I am here to punish you
for cultivating this corrosive force.

42
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,342
How dare you insult all
we stand for, intruder?

43
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,518
Unh!

44
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:49,523
[groans]

45
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:53,194
I hope that you are finished
with your futile resistance.

46
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:56,831
Our Queen needs medical care.
Please let us take her to the infirmary.

47
00:03:56,898 --> 00:04:02,069
You may try and save her, but it is for
nothing, just as love is for nothing.

48
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:05,406
The best way to find Aya
is to get to Oa and scan from there.

49
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:07,241
We're two months from Oa.

50
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:10,678
Sure. At regular speed, but
an ultra-warp... 10 minutes tops,

51
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:12,180
if we don't stop for coffee.

52
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:15,777
Ultra-warp without a nav A.I.?
Way to risky.

53
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,621
One tiny rounding error,

54
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:20,456
and we end up smack dab inside
the molten core of a planet.

55
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:24,808
But if you're right about how volatile
Aya is, we have no choice.

56
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:26,944
Why do you want
to destroy us?

57
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,932
Yes, we serve love because
love is the one thing

58
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:33,502
that will eventually bring peace
and harmony to the Universe.

59
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,939
If you had ever felt love,
you would know you are wrong.

60
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:39,608
I have loved, I do love.

61
00:04:39,676 --> 00:04:42,444
Who do you love that you
are so sure of this?

62
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:45,281
I love Hal Jordan of Earth.

63
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:47,588
And who does he love?

64
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:50,778
He loves another.

65
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:54,087
So your love has brought
you nothing but pain.

66
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,093
Yes. I mean, no.

67
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,396
How will that pain bring
peace to the Universe?

68
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:02,799
It will... I cannot say.

69
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:06,618
You have dedicated your life,
your entire planet's purpose

70
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,405
to something
you cannot explain.

71
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:14,477
We gained our understanding of love
from a teacher who is not on Zamaron.

72
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:20,483
- Then bring this teacher here.
- Impossible. She is half a Universe away.

73
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:23,386
Teleport her with your
crystalline apparatus.

74
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:24,754
We cannot.

75
00:05:24,822 --> 00:05:28,057
The portal reunites beings
that share a love between them.

76
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,660
It cannot bring one
without the other.

77
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:35,298
Your supposition and technology
are respectively wrong and primitive.

78
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:36,833
Unh!

79
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:05,223
Oh, not again...

80
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,972
Will this take long?
The buffet closes in 5 minutes.

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,305
Carol Ferris, I am sorry
you were taken so abruptly

82
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:18,569
and in the middle of
such important matters.

83
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:23,583
It was not our choice.
You were brought here by this Aya.

84
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,385
Right...

85
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:29,989
Aya comes to us for answers about love,
so I thought it best you speak to her.

86
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,325
Well, of course it...
Wait. What now?

87
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:35,026
Carol Ferris of Earth,
can you convince me

88
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:38,264
that the Zamarons and love
should not be destroyed?

89
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:42,502
Well, I... Wait. Destroyed?
Wait. You want to destroy love?

90
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,868
I will destroy love's proxy
in the Universe,

91
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:49,176
the Zamaron home world, unless
you can give me a reason not to.

92
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:54,448
Oh. So no pressure then.
Well, um, I don't know.

93
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:58,952
Love is a battlefield,
love is patient, love is kind.

94
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,490
My love was unkind. He offered
his love, then took it back.

95
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:08,361
Oh. Uh, OK. Well, it is not proud.
It is not easily angered.

96
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:12,776
False. When love is revoked,
it creates anger and resentment.

97
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:14,637
Aah!

98
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:19,239
- Carol, tell Aya what you told me.
- I don't know!

99
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:25,317
OK. All I said is that love is about
doing what's best for the one your love.

100
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:30,106
It's as simple as putting his or her needs
before your own, but I'm no expert.

101
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:34,789
- I'm just someone who fell in love.
- Whom did you love?

102
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:38,894
I loved Hal Jordan...
Love Hal Jordan.

103
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:40,562
I guess that's the hard part.

104
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,833
I'll always love him, even
though he makes me so angry.

105
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:48,670
Then you hate and love the
same person simultaneously.

106
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:50,921
I could never hate Hal.

107
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:55,244
He may drive me crazy, but
he'll always have a place in my heart.

108
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:58,915
So you posit that love
is stronger than hate.

109
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:02,719
- Of course.
- Excellent. We shall see.

110
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:06,055
There shall be a trial by
combat between love and hate.

111
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:12,228
- Emotions can't really fight each other.
- Negative. I will force them to.

112
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:21,337
All right. Looks like
we're ready for ultra-warp.

113
00:08:21,405 --> 00:08:24,493
Aya makes those calculations
in a fraction of a second.

114
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:26,976
Raze has been working
on that for 3 hours.

115
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:30,080
I'm reasonably sure
I addressed all of the variables.

116
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:33,984
Oh, as long as you're <i>reasonably sure</i>...
Jordan, look at this map.

117
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:37,321
There are 50 near misses
in the anders nebula alone.

118
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:40,925
No human brain can react fast enough
to get through that alive.

119
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:44,308
Flying is mostly instinct.
There's no brain involved.

120
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:48,298
- You know what I mean.
- It's worth it if it gets us to Aya.

121
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:51,401
Razer's right.
She needs our help now.

122
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:58,242
In 3, 2, 1, and power.

123
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:08,057
How exactly are you gonna make
love and hate fight each other?

124
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,234
I will summon
hate's champion.

125
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,228
Who freed me from my cell?

126
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:22,796
A Green Lantern?

127
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:26,102
Errr!

128
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,768
Not quite.

129
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:33,146
Atrocitus of the Red Lanterns,
you are here to represent hate

130
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:35,873
in a fight to the death
against love's champion,

131
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,408
Carol Ferris of Earth.

132
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:39,934
No! Carol Ferris
is an innocent.

133
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:42,412
Please let me be
love's champion.

134
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,750
You yourself said Carol Ferris possesses
the greatest understanding of love.

135
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,318
She is chosen.

136
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:51,321
And why should I agree
to this melee?

137
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:54,812
Should you win, the prize
is your freedom and the death

138
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:59,252
of your opponent Hal Jordan's
one true love, Carol Ferris.

139
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,233
That is acceptable.

140
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,294
Wait. This is nuts!
I can't fight an alien warlord.

141
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:11,041
Are those serrated teeth?

142
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:14,087
[chiming]

143
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:17,213
Here. The Star Sapphire Ring
you returned before.

144
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,328
Right. Because if I'm gonna
be battling to the death,

145
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:21,859
I should at least be
well-accessorized.

146
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,551
Of course
the fight must be fair.

147
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,467
Atrocitus should have
his Power Ring, as well.

148
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:46,010
Ha! Errr.

149
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:51,649
Yaaah!

150
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:56,054
Aah!

151
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:59,663
[breathing heavily]

152
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:03,660
Are you insane?
How is that fair?

153
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:11,268
Coming out of ultra-warp
in 3, 2, 1.

154
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,276
Did this figure into
your calculations?

155
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,913
We've jumped right into
the atmosphere of a star.

156
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,681
I see that.

157
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,801
One half a degree,
and we'd have been vaporized.

158
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:48,105
But instead we're alive, and
we're that much closer to Oa.

159
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:50,678
- Next time, we'll just remember to...
- Next time?!

160
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,230
Uh-uh. We're never
doing that again.

161
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:02,522
Errrr.

162
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:07,287
Aya, I am not the champion of love.
Please call this off!

163
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:09,923
Fight or die.

164
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:13,293
Ha!

165
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,445
[growling]

166
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:33,650
Unimpressive.

167
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:42,119
Think, Carol, think!

168
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,203
Rawwr!

169
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,412
I can't do this, I can't!

170
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,448
Wait. The Star Sapphire's
special power.

171
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,519
Bring me the one I love.

172
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,335
Carol!

173
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,364
<i>Atrocitus!</i>

174
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,266
Jordan, wait!

175
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:51,417
Only the strength of love
could bring Carol Ferris a hero.

176
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:55,969
Hal Jordan, please be safe.

177
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:59,665
- Do you know what the heck that was?
- He's been transported to Zamaron.

178
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:04,511
Then we got to high-tail it there.
Atrocitus was waiting for him, Atrocitus!

179
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:08,377
Zamaron is in Frontier Space.
We'd have to use ultra-warp.

180
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,017
Then let's go.

181
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:32,427
When last we met, human,
I had just conquered Oa.

182
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:36,408
This time, you find
me better rested.

183
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,862
The Star Sapphire Ring doesn't let you
drag just anyone across the Universe.

184
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:09,867
It was either you
or my high-school prom date,

185
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:11,910
And he's an accountant
in Tucson.

186
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,979
Errr!

187
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,189
Aah!

188
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:28,267
Carol!

189
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,338
Unh!

190
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,869
[gasp]

191
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,209
[growling]

192
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,711
No!

193
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,848
Unh!

194
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,010
Ghiata, no.

195
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:58,603
This wasn't your fight.

196
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:05,055
Your mate is next.

197
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:29,319
I've had just about enough of you!
You are done, over!

198
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:57,131
Ghiata, you shouldn't have.

199
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:04,815
There is no greater privilege than
to perform a deed born of pure love

200
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:13,090
and no greater honor than
that it should be my last.

201
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:22,773
There is your proof that love
is the strongest force in the Universe.

202
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,377
Only love could cause
beings to put themselves

203
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,469
so completely
in harm's way,

204
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,132
and then make the ultimate sacrifice:
one's life.

205
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:43,059
I am comforted that Ghiata
did not die in vain.

206
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:48,832
She proved love is superior and
saved our planet from destruction.

207
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:51,590
We owe her our lives.

208
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:54,768
Love is not superior.

209
00:17:55,772 --> 00:17:57,466
But I represented love,

210
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:00,002
and I am not the one smashed
under a rock right now.

211
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:01,984
I won, we won.

212
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:04,346
No. Atrocitus lost.

213
00:18:04,414 --> 00:18:07,349
He and his ring shall be sent
back from where they came.

214
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,919
<i>His failure is unacceptable.</i>

215
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:19,162
Aah!

216
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:33,041
Aya, please listen to me.

217
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:35,877
Just stop and consider
everything that's happened here.

218
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:38,406
I... we would like to help you.

219
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:41,754
This trial demonstrated
that love causes only pain.

220
00:18:41,793 --> 00:18:44,920
It foolishly led Ghiata
to her own destruction.

221
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:49,025
No. It led her to an act
of total selflessness.

222
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,961
All life is pain.

223
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:54,322
I now understand that the best thing
I can do for the Universe

224
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,046
is to eliminate all life

225
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:59,870
and replace it with emotionless
machines like my loyal Manhunters.

226
00:18:59,944 --> 00:19:01,985
What?! Aya, that's crazy.

227
00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:04,654
You fought alongside me
against the same enemies.

228
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:07,267
You were as alive as I am,
and now...

229
00:19:07,307 --> 00:19:10,509
Prepare for the total annihilation
of Zamaron.

230
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:18,789
No, Aya.
I won't let you do this.

231
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:27,031
I do not recall
giving you a choice.

232
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,081
Aya!

233
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,826
Aya, what are you doing?

234
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:02,411
To destroy life a single planet
at a time is illogical and inefficient.

235
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,773
I will find a way to erase all
life in one motion

236
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:11,352
and remake the entire Universe
in my own image, free of all emotion.

237
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:32,163
Carol Ferris, and Hal Jordan,
you have saved us from destruction.

238
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,699
We are forever grateful.

239
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:39,838
I only wish we could have saved Ghiata.
She is a true hero.

240
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,341
We'll keep her in our hearts.

241
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,479
The last time you were here,

242
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:48,774
you returned the Star Sapphire Ring,
and this time?

243
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,520
I think I'll keep it.

244
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:57,054
You never know when
it might come in handy.

245
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,890
You honor us by doing so.

246
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,832
So...

247
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,123
Thanks for being there
when I called, Hal.

248
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,976
I'll be seeing you around...
The galaxy.

249
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:24,945
