00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:07,572
The Simpsons S19E12 (KABF05)
Love, Springfieldian Style

2
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:27,562
<i>L is for the way you look at me</i>

3
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:34,095
<i>O is for the only one I see</i>

4
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:40,489
<i>V is very, very extraordinary</i>

5
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:35,625
Sweet on you

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,996
Release the hounds

7
00:00:40,496 --> 00:00:44,458
<i>E is even more than
anyone that you adore</i>

8
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:48,122
I can't wait to see my
Valentine's Day surprise.

9
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,955
Good, 'cause I'm parking
at it right now.

10
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:53,920
A carnival?

11
00:00:53,963 --> 00:00:56,089
What's so romantic
about this?

12
00:00:56,087 --> 00:00:57,459
- Bye!
- See you later!

13
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,725
For the next two hours,
we'll be kid-free.

14
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:04,023
It'll be just like the time
we lost them at the mall.

15
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,603
That was the best
Christmas ever.

16
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,131
Ah, the Tunnel of Love.

17
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:13,611
Nothing gets a woman
in your arms faster

18
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,383
than scary robots
and simulated privacy.

19
00:01:31,415 --> 00:01:32,602
Marge!
Look over there!

20
00:01:37,777 --> 00:01:39,131
Mom and Dad are in there.

21
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:40,150
Want to ruin
their fun?

22
00:01:40,158 --> 00:01:42,550
Bart, no, it's
Valentine's Day.

23
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:43,403
Okay...

24
00:01:43,408 --> 00:01:44,931
but if Dad kisses
Mom too much,

25
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:46,643
a stork will lay an angel
egg in her tummy,

26
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,760
and the next thing you know,

27
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:49,762
we find a baby brother
in the cabbage patch!

28
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:50,952
Here's a thumbnail sketch:

29
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,261
In the first place, you...

30
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:55,613
Do whatever you want.

31
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm getting a candy apple.

32
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:18,380
Due to a classic Jell-O prank,

33
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:20,152
this ride has been disabled.

34
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:24,152
Please remain in your boats.

35
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:25,802
You will be charged
for the extra time.

36
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:30,692
This is a terrible
Valentine's Day.

37
00:02:30,698 --> 00:02:32,533
What if I told you
some of the greatest

38
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:34,521
love stories of all time?

39
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:37,672
"Romeo and Juliet"?

40
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:38,852
"Arthur and Guinevere"?

41
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:39,912
Brangelina?

42
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:44,123
Even better, a tale of...

43
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:45,050
One moment.

44
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:51,323
A tale of two young
outlaws in love.

45
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:54,372
<i>They were the Bonnie and Clyde
of their day.</i>

46
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,981
<i>Their names were
Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

47
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:58,180
Miss Bonnie,

48
00:02:58,185 --> 00:03:00,843
might I escort you
to the picture show?

49
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,900
I swear I won't misbehave.

50
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:04,331
Then no, thank you.

51
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:05,851
This is Texas,

52
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:08,273
future home of
Akeem Olajuwon!

53
00:03:08,278 --> 00:03:10,540
And I've got dreams
as big as he will be.

54
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:12,023
I want action!

55
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:14,243
Action, eh?

56
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:17,582
Clyde Barrow,

57
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:19,021
local bad boy.

58
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:20,181
Bonnie Parker.

59
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:22,193
Say, if you're so bad,

60
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:25,853
you could go stick up that
feed store over yonder.

61
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:27,401
Hmm.

62
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,750
Unless...

63
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:30,513
you're chicken.

64
00:03:30,518 --> 00:03:32,411
No one calls me "chicken" without

65
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:34,733
goading me into
doing something stupid!

66
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:42,183
Ya idjit!

67
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:44,591
You could've had anything
you want for free!

68
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:46,361
You're a co-owner!

69
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:48,701
I'll see you at Thanksgiving!

70
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:53,622
Oats!

71
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:55,951
Texas caviar!

72
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,442
Good times.

73
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:05,122
Finally.
Some excitement.

74
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:08,400
<i>Wow, I guess violence
is her only turn-on.</i>

75
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:09,583
<i>Well, there might be others,</i>

76
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:11,310
<i>but I'm too lazy to
figure out what they are.</i>

77
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:12,692
<i>So violence it is!</i>

78
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:16,451
Oh, there's somethin'
this kissin' is missin'.

79
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:24,672
Oh, Clyde, you know
just what a girl likes.

80
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,510
Why are you shooting at us?

81
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,862
We cooperated fully!

82
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:33,033
It's a sex thing!

83
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:33,963
Say no more!

84
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,021
Hey, can I give you folks a lift?

85
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,701
Yes, to a series of banks,
up and down the state.

86
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:40,283
Banks?

87
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:42,032
Well, deposit yourselves in a seat

88
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,692
because you've earned my interest!

89
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:50,560
Dateline: Texas.

90
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:54,061
<i>A nation, crippled by unemployment
and bored by Seabiscuit,</i>

91
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:56,773
<i>embraces two unlikely folk heroes.</i>

92
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:01,941
<i>Bonnie and Clyde souvenirs
are flying off the shelves,</i>

93
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:05,833
<i>and the Dust Bowl duo has
inspired their own radio show.</i>

94
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,383
Uh, Bonnie, where did you
put the money we stole?

95
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:09,721
I filed it under "G."

96
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,600
Under "G"?

97
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:12,181
Why would you
file it under "G"?

98
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:14,592
Because gee, it's swell
to have all that money.

99
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:15,281
I see.

100
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:19,922
Their notoriety has reached
the highest levels of government

101
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:22,773
To deal with the menace
of Bonnie and Clyde,

102
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:27,542
I am recalling all our air
defense forces from Pearl Harbor.

103
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:31,682
Somebody please remind
me to move them back.

104
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:35,133
I would be honored to perform that duty.

105
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:36,641
They're outlaws?!

106
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:38,890
I've been played
like a pair of spoons!

107
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,342
Well, who am I to judge?

108
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:42,322
It's the Depression, money's tight...

109
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:44,881
<i>Anyone who sees this
unmarried couple should...</i>

110
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,843
Unmarried?!

111
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:47,653
That's it.
I'm turning them in.

112
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:49,033
Hey, keep it down, will ya?

113
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:51,203
The part where all my men
get killed is coming up.

114
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:54,182
Listen, Sheriff, I can help
you take down Bonnie and Clyde.

115
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:56,953
After the racially
insensitive cartoon.

116
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,753
One taco coming up.

117
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:17,463
Even I'm offended by this,

118
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:19,623
and I'm a fat Southern sheriff.

119
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:23,170
Um...

120
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:24,763
the battery seems
to be dead.

121
00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:27,472
I'll get some help by
hiding in that bush.

122
00:06:28,057 --> 00:06:30,072
Come on, shoot! Shoot!

123
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:32,070
Oh! Not me!

124
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,193
Bonnie, I love you.

125
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,110
Will you marry me?

126
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:38,350
I don't know.

127
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,970
I guess I'm just looking
for a little more excitement.

128
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:44,271
Okay, but if you change your mind,
you know where I'm at.

129
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:46,860
Mm, I think we should see other people.

130
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:48,351
Say, Officer,

131
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:50,381
I like how you handle that gun.

132
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:51,070
Thanks.

133
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:53,283
I like the way
you take a bullet.

134
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:55,471
Hey, back off!
She's my girl!

135
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:57,171
Damn, just my luck!

136
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:00,611
Cool. Now we're shooting the birds

137
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:02,300
that are pecking at the bodies.

138
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:11,223
So that's the end
of the story, huh?

139
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:12,200
You'd think so, but...

140
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:18,562
We want to hear a story.

141
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:20,500
A story suitable for children.

142
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,210
All right.

143
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:24,960
This is a story of two
dogs with a love so strong,

144
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:27,159
no hose could separate them.

145
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:29,659
I call it Shady and the Vamp.

146
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:41,615
She's so beautiful.

147
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:44,761
Imagine what she looks
like with her collar off.

148
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:47,922
A mutt like you could never
get a fancy dame like that.

149
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:50,250
Even her fleas have more class than you.

150
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:56,683
Lady Bitington, will you be summering
in the hindquarters again this year?

151
00:07:56,765 --> 00:07:57,841
Oh, no!

152
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:00,970
Chompy and I have taken
a cottage in West Leg.

153
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:03,743
It's where all the fleas are fleeing.

154
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:07,823
Watch and learn.

155
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:17,491
You know, heaven must have
left its doggie door open

156
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,772
because you are one...

157
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:27,943
Oh, you poor thing!

158
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:32,953
Is there anything I can do?

159
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:35,343
You can have dinner with me.

160
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:36,723
All right.

161
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,471
But keep your nose
where I can see it.

162
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:39,890
Can you bring
a friend for me?

163
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:42,023
I like those chicks
with them head cones

164
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:44,842
when they start talking, you
can drop below the horizon.

165
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:57,551
Oh, Shady, you on a date, huh?

166
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:58,890
How's it-a goin'?

167
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:02,182
You say it's goin' kinda-a rough?

168
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,370
That is precisely
what I'm saying.

169
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,663
Sit down. Sit down.

170
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:08,072
I bring-a you a
nice-a bowl of Chianti.

171
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:24,243
Let go! Let go!

172
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:26,960
No. You let go of the spaghetti!

173
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:35,231
You're pretty feisty
for an upper-class bitch.

174
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:39,860
Oh, I like that you use the
technical termfor a female dog.

175
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,900
Run, run!

176
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:43,980
The health inspector man,
he's-a here!

177
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:48,341
Why didn't I listen to Mama?

178
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:50,951
"Serve-a food to humans!"

179
00:09:54,398 --> 00:09:57,603
I have to admit,
that was exciting.

180
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:59,842
And I am in heat.

181
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:01,233
That's the safe time, right?

182
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:02,920
Oh, the safest.

183
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,581
That was the most...

184
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:17,670
wonderful night of my life.

185
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:19,213
That's odd.

186
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:20,840
I'm never sickin
the morning.

187
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:21,983
What could it be?

188
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:22,790
Oh, uh...

189
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:24,650
Is that a foxhunt I hear?

190
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,052
Shady!

191
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:36,981
I haven't seen Shady in weeks.

192
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:42,432
Any minute now

193
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:46,410
He'll scamper through
that doggie door

194
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,103
Any minute now

195
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:52,070
I'll be the dog
she's lookin' for

196
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:54,071
Any minute now

197
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:57,641
You'll be stuck
with her brood

198
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,542
Any minute now

199
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:04,360
This pooch will know she's screwed

200
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:09,273
My heart tells
me to trust him

201
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:13,512
But your head knows
he's a hound

202
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:16,581
I want to do the right thing

203
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:20,531
Come on, with all this
high-class tail around?

204
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:23,263
Any minute now

205
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:27,211
Our girl will make
a brand-new start

206
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:28,763
Yesss!

207
00:11:28,827 --> 00:11:30,942
Any minute now

208
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:35,351
I won't care that
he broke my heart

209
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:42,160
Any minute now.

210
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:48,291
- Where's our dad?
- We need Daddy!

211
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:50,021
- I want to go find Daddy!
- Where's Daddy?!

212
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,442
I don't wanna hear another
word about your father.

213
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:06,953
We gotta find our daddy.

214
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,101
Yeah, he's gotta teach
me how to lick my...

215
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,782
Oh, I figured it out.

216
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:11,632
You go ahead.

217
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:12,743
Come on!

218
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,560
- Oh, Shady!
- Oh, Shady!

219
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:16,300
- Shady!
- Shady!

220
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:18,183
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

221
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:20,671
- We need you, Daddy!
- Daddy!

222
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,222
Ah, got ya!

223
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:27,043
You strays are going
straight to the pound

224
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,780
where you're put to sleep...

225
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:32,353
by my boring stories.

226
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:33,603
And then you'll be killed!

227
00:12:38,587 --> 00:12:40,833
Ah, looks like that problem
solved it self.

228
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:44,000
Now, uh, how 'bout you and
me sniff each other's butts?

229
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:46,382
I'm just kiddin'.

230
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:48,103
Unless you want to.

231
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:56,202
Well, Looks like it's just
you and me again tonight.

232
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:10,502
Gawrsh, you can't kill me.

233
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:11,883
I'm half-human!

234
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:13,430
Look, I wear clothes!

235
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:14,703
I speak English!

236
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:16,852
I'm speaking it right now!

237
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:18,792
Sure you are.

238
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:28,572
You two are next.

239
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,222
Here's your last meal.

240
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,640
It's Cycle 5,

241
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:35,550
specially formulated for
dogs with five minutes to live.

242
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:40,362
Don't bite the hand
that kills ye!

243
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:45,250
Yay, Dad!

244
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:47,221
I knew you'd
come save us!

245
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:49,030
You two are going home,

246
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:50,731
and I'm coming with ya!

247
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:56,790
This place is no picnic,

248
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:59,373
but it sure beats
working for Disney.

249
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:10,152
Look who we found!

250
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:11,593
Can I keep him?
Can we keep him?

251
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:13,282
Well, that depends.

252
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,993
Does he want to stay?

253
00:14:14,996 --> 00:14:18,850
I want to stay, sit,
roll over and beg!

254
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,663
Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please...!

255
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:24,540
All right,
we can be a family.

256
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:27,711
All four of us.

257
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:29,563
Uh... you know,

258
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,961
there are nine other puppies.

259
00:14:40,938 --> 00:14:44,770
Even love is boring when
you're stuck in a tunnel of it.

260
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:46,522
Well, I've got a
Valentine's Day story!

261
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:48,893
It's about musicians
from a simpler time.

262
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:52,752
The era of The Brady Bunch,
Donny and Marie and...

263
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:55,981
Smash the flag

264
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:57,870
Burn the queen

265
00:14:57,908 --> 00:14:59,621
Kick the sky

266
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:01,903
Antichrist!

267
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,211
Nancy, what are the odds?

268
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:09,823
You sign up for a
semester at U. of London;

269
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,121
then I immediately
do the same.

270
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:14,301
Yeah, I'm really lucky
you saved me

271
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:17,611
from meeting other people
and having new experiences.

272
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:22,721
What is that raw,
primo sound?

273
00:15:22,857 --> 00:15:24,240
You can't go in there.

274
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:26,132
Our guide book
says not to!

275
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,461
<i>Hitler and her majesty</i>

276
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:31,130
<i>Sittin' in a tree</i>

277
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:34,630
<i>B-O-R-R-I-N-G!</i>

278
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,423
You rule, Sid Vicious!

279
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:37,810
You sicken me!

280
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:42,621
Why am I hittin' myself?

281
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,210
Why am I hittin' myself?

282
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:46,610
He's so uncompromising.

283
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:50,361
He'd never go for an uncool
spelling bee champion like me.

284
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:52,112
I've spelled "unrequited."

285
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,182
Now I know
what it means.

286
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:56,570
Yo. I got Duds, Chunks, Twix,

287
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:58,752
Cadbury's, any way you want to go.

288
00:15:58,758 --> 00:15:59,981
Chocolate?

289
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:03,063
Nancy's too smart to
put that in her body.

290
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:06,251
It's only for losers,
like musicians and...

291
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,451
Musicians?!

292
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,001
That's my girlfriend.

293
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:12,571
Then I guess you'll be
paying for her chocolate.

294
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:14,392
Uh, okay.

295
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:15,090
Gotcha!

296
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:16,982
That's nice work,
Officer Otto.

297
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:19,090
Happy to be of service,
old bean.

298
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,012
<i>...cannon, neat, neat, neat</i>

299
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,593
<i>She can't afford a gun at all
Neat, neat, neat.</i>

300
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:29,090
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

301
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:29,730
<i>Night!</i>

302
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:32,812
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

303
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:33,442
<i>Night!</i>

304
00:16:33,446 --> 00:16:36,320
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

305
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:36,922
<i>Night!</i>

306
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,911
Look, an American
nerd bird.

307
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:47,952
Nerd bird?

308
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,092
Would a nerd bird
have chocolate, huh?

309
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:51,460
Would a nerd bird?

310
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:52,992
Stop saying "nerd bird!"

311
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:54,483
Chocolate is boring.

312
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:56,213
Maybe I'll have a piece.

313
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:59,572
You know, just to see
how boring it is.

314
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:05,691
Oh, you're offering
me some?

315
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:07,573
Um... I guess I could.

316
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:09,721
I mean, I do it all the time!

317
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:15,051
- Oh!
- Oh!

318
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:18,740
Yup, it's boring all right.

319
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:19,962
How much more you got?

320
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:20,881
Lots.

321
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:23,391
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone?</i>

322
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:26,150
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

323
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:28,643
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

324
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,692
<i>You shouldn't've
fallen in love with?</i>

325
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:34,402
<i>I can't see much of a future</i>

326
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:37,301
<i>Unless we find out
what's to blame</i>

327
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,860
<i>What a shame</i>

328
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:45,262
<i>And we won't be
together much longer</i>

329
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:49,532
<i>Unless we realize
that we are the same</i>

330
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:55,540
<i>Ever fallen in love
with someone</i>

331
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:58,212
<i>Ever fallen in love

332
00:17:58,217 --> 00:18:00,961
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

333
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:03,770
<i>You shouldn't've fallen
in love with?</i>

334
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:11,002
We're gonna go out
and play our songs

335
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,933
like we've never played them
before: competently!

336
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,091
Where's Sid?

337
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:19,871
Sidney Sheldon Vicious!

338
00:18:19,877 --> 00:18:22,422
Where you been,
chompin' Wonka?

339
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:27,973
When I hired a guy
named Sid Vicious,

340
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:31,252
I assumed it would be a 30-year
business relationship.

341
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:34,391
I told you to hire
Tom Responsible.

342
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,712
Slag off.

343
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:39,310
Here they are, all the way
from outside of Texas:

344
00:18:39,315 --> 00:18:41,320
the Sex Pistols.

345
00:18:44,326 --> 00:18:46,190
<i>Education's bollocks!</i>

346
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,581
<i>Bollocks!
America is bollocks!</i>

347
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:52,541
<i>Bollocks!
Politeness is bollocks!</i>

348
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:55,070
<i>Bollocks!
Bollocks!</i>

349
00:18:55,977 --> 00:18:57,822
Can't reach me bass.

350
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,590
Me back is front ward!

351
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:09,563
Dang it, I wanted to hear
what else was bollocks!

352
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:16,271
You gobbed up our gig,
you git!

353
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:21,181
You leave Sid alone!
He doesn't need you!

354
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:23,090
He's quitting the band!

355
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:24,480
I'm doing what now?

356
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:25,740
You're quitting the band.

357
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,362
He's going solo, and I'm
gonna write his songs!

358
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:29,212
Yeah!

359
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:31,390
Hey, you guys want to
be in my new band?

360
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:33,410
Ho!! Just stop talking

361
00:19:33,415 --> 00:19:35,741
and bang your head
against the wall!

362
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:38,452
I'm doing this
'cause I want to,

363
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:39,911
not 'cause she told me to.

364
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,342
Bang harder!

365
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:41,973
Yes, pet.

366
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:49,020
<i>'Cause love is the elixir</i>

367
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:51,673
<i>The potion of emotion</i>

368
00:19:51,677 --> 00:19:54,212
<i>The world-saving fixer</i>

369
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:57,052
<i>The lotion of devotion.</i>

370
00:19:57,138 --> 00:19:59,500
This song doesn't make
me feel angry at all.

371
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:02,320
If anything, it makes
my anger ebb!

372
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:06,982
Your music violates everything
punk stands for,

373
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:07,970
which is nothing!

374
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:10,012
You are no longer
welcome at CBGB's...

375
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:11,970
Comic Book Guy's Bar

376
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,641
Oh, forget those jerks.

377
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,642
Let's go back to the hotel
and get Snicker-faced.

378
00:20:16,656 --> 00:20:19,860
Oh, I love you,
my Hershey hero.

379
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:22,353
And I love you,
Tootsie Roll.

380
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:34,970
Happy Valentine's Day

381
00:20:34,975 --> 00:20:36,943
and shut your gob.
