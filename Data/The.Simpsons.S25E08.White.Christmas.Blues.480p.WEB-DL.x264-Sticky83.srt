1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,799
HENRY: Come on, come on.
DANNY: Oh, oh. Got it.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,150
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Aah! Aah!

3
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:06,601
What? Come on.

4
00:00:06,603 --> 00:00:08,203
(whistle blows on TV)
- Hands of stone. - Come on.

5
00:00:08,205 --> 00:00:10,105
Not again?!
Got to catch it like...

6
00:00:10,107 --> 00:00:12,074
That's the third pass he dropped.
I know.

7
00:00:12,076 --> 00:00:13,909
Where's Frank? It's getting kind
of late, you know.

8
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:15,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he slipped away after mass.

9
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:16,745
Said something came up.

10
00:00:16,747 --> 00:00:18,297
Come on! Go for it!
Fourth down. Let's go.

11
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:19,832
Fourth and one.
They got to go for it.

12
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:21,116
They got to
go for it.

13
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:22,284
On behalf
of Jets fans everywhere,

14
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:23,618
I'd like to thank
the three of you

15
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,786
for becoming cops
and not coaches.

16
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:25,971
(laughter)
What do you mean?

17
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:27,956
They get the first down here,
they win the game.

18
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,058
Or they lose it
if they can't convert.

19
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,127
The smart play
a coffin corner kick.

20
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:33,345
A what?
HENRY: No.

21
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:34,563
What's that?

22
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:36,631
Punt inside
the five-yard line.

23
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,317
Mom, you are so weird.

24
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,651
Well, I grew up
in a house full of guys.

25
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:40,819
What do you expect?

26
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:42,020
Great, they're punting.

27
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:45,157
Oh. See?
See? See? What did I say?

28
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,492
Coffin corner kick.

29
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:47,326
Hey, Francis.

30
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:49,111
Hi.

31
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:50,412
There you are. Guys, it's time
to wash up for dinner.

32
00:00:50,414 --> 00:00:51,613
Ah, let 'em watch
the end of the game.

33
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:52,915
You're missing a hell
of a game, Dad.

34
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:54,199
Heard it on the radio.

35
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:56,201
You've been gone a long time.
Is everything okay?

36
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:57,986
I'm fine. Where do you get
a beer around here?

37
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:00,122
SPORTSCASTER:
Fumble! Fumble! Fumble!

38
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:02,508
Touchdown!

39
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,825
Touchdown!

40
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:06,712
(screaming and cheering)

41
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:08,046
(whooping)

42
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:11,133
(chanting):
J-E-T-S. Jets! Jets! Jets!

43
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:12,601
DANNY:
<i>Let me hear you guys!</i>

44
00:01:12,603 --> 00:01:15,804
DANNY, JACK, SEAN & LINDA:
<i>J-E-T-S. Jets! Jets! Jets!</i>

45
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:19,191
<i>J-E-T-S. Jets! Jets! Jets!</i>

46
00:01:19,193 --> 00:01:21,570
That was a great dinner
tonight, wasn't it, guys?

47
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:22,011
Yeah.

48
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:24,179
Lively conversation as usual.

49
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:26,848
Yeah, I particularly liked the
way you so subtly worked in

50
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,534
our little neighborhood
halfway house situation

51
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:29,952
into the discussion.

52
00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:31,403
I thought
your father should know

53
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:34,022
that the state of New York
put a home for criminals

54
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:35,991
a few blocks from where his
grandchildren play, that's all.

55
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:38,377
He knows,
and you know he knows. Come on.

56
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:40,412
He's the police commissioner.
He's not the governor.

57
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:42,197
There's nothing
he can do about it.

58
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,032
What was with
your father anyway?

59
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:45,083
He seemed quiet.

60
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:47,085
Babe, he does the same thing
every Sunday.

61
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:48,420
He sits there, he groans,

62
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:49,704
he grunts, and then he
says one little thing.

63
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:50,756
Danny! Danny! Danny!

64
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:52,257
What? Come on.
He's always quiet.

65
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,560
Well, I know. Just more so
than usual, you know?

66
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:56,812
That's him. I didn't notice anything.
I can't believe you...

67
00:01:56,814 --> 00:01:58,213
Danny, look out!

68
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:00,048
(tires screeching, man groaning)

69
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:02,684
What was that?
(gasps)

70
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:04,552
You all right? All right, all right.
Are you guys okay?

71
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:06,355
- You okay? - Yeah. Listen.
- Everyone stay here, okay?

72
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:07,940
You sure?
Stay put.

73
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:10,442
LINDA:
You guys okay?

74
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:12,560
JACK:
Yeah.

75
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,530
You sure you guys are okay, right?
Yeah, I'm okay.

76
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:17,032
Hey.

77
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:19,201
You all right, buddy?

78
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:21,837
Still breathing.
All right.

79
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,455
Hang in there, all right?

80
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:25,007
Step away!

81
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,709
Get the hell out of here!

82
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,761
Why don't you take it easy
with that, all right?

83
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:31,713
I said go!
Okay.

84
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:33,882
Listen, we got an injured man
here, all right?

85
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:36,852
Why don't you just take it easy,
let me help him, all right?

86
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:38,086
And then, we'll deal with it.

87
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:38,720
Do it!

88
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:41,089
All right.

89
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:42,224
Police! Drop it!

90
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:44,443
(gunfire)

91
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:45,611

LINDA:
Danny?

93
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:50,198
Danny!

94
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,785
Danny! Danny?

95
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:56,405
Danny.
You okay?

96
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:57,956
Danny, I don't know.
I don't know.

97
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,875
Are you okay?
You okay? Is anybody hit?

98
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:02,294
No, but it's right here, Dad.
We're okay.

99
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:04,496
(crying):
Oh, my God, Danny.

100
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:06,131
You all right?
SEAN: Yeah.

101
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,300

dropping everything
on your night off.

116
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:57,955
Stop sucking up. You know
you'd be my first call, too.

117
00:03:57,957 --> 00:04:00,090
How we doing on the blood? I'm
pretty sure I creased his arm.

118
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:01,375
Well, there's not
a lot of blood,

119
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:02,960
but there's enough
for a DNA profile.

120
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:04,344
All right. Remind those lab rats

121
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:06,463
where they got their playoff
tickets from, all right?

122
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:08,966
And tonight, the blood,
the slug from my car--

123
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:10,183
everything jumps the line, Jack.

124
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,252
I got it, Danny.
All right.

125
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:15,722
Go ahead, go take care
of Linda and the kids.

126
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:24,231
I got lucky, you know.

127
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,266
I got him in the arm.

128
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:30,988
He left some blood at the scene,
which means I got his DNA now.

129
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,906
It's gonna make it

130
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:36,793
real easy to catch
this son of a bitch.

131
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:38,912
I notified every hospital
in the city.

132
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:41,965
Any gunshot wound shows up
anywhere in the city,

133
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:43,500
in any of the five boroughs,

134
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:46,103
and I am the first call
they're gonna make.

135
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:52,392
Odds are, a guy like that
is in the system, you know?

136
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:55,062
My money says he gets popped

137
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:56,480
tomorrow, and if he does...
Danny. Danny.

138
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:57,764
...I'm gonna pop
him real good, too.

139
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,795
Don't worry, babe.
- Just stop. - Don't worry.

140
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:01,602
Just stop talking.
I promise you

141
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:02,986
I'm gonna get him.
Stop talking.

142
00:05:02,988 --> 00:05:04,071
What do you mean, stop talking?

143
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:05,489

Just stop.

146
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:11,194

LINDA: I'm good.

152
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:27,494
I'm good.

153
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:29,880
But the boys,
you know, they, uh...

154
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,665
They were right there, Frank.

155
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,300
They-they saw the whole thing.

156
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:35,302
Yeah, I know. Danny told me.

157
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:36,670
How are they now?

158
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:38,805
I don't know. Um...

159
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:41,358
Stunned, I think.

160
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,176
Jack has been quiet.

161
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:44,861
Well, give it some time.

162
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:46,446
It'll tell you what they need.

163
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:47,681
Yeah.

164
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:49,816
Can...? I'm sorry, Frank.

165
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:52,986
Can I ask you a question?
I just...

166
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:54,905
I want to know, uh...

167
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:59,660
Would you have done
anything differently?

168
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:01,695
Not a thing.

169
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:03,697
Call me if you need anything.

170
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,882
Okay.

171
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:09,035
Where were we?

172
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:11,304
Chief Hunter's authorization
request to run his

173
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:13,206
undercover across
the river in Newark.

174
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,708
It'll have to wait.

175
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,843
I'll be down on 13 with Garrett.

176
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,849
Well, what do you mean,
he's not in the system?

177
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:24,434
And I'm telling you,
you're missing something,

178
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:25,652
so run him again.

179
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:27,220
Danny, they ran it three times.

180
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:28,772
There's no DNA match.

181
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:29,906
What is the holdup
with this hospital?

182
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:31,324
Why can't I speak
to my victim?

183
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:33,443
(sighing): They're checking
with the doctor now.

184
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:36,229
Tell them that it is
an urgent NYPD matter, okay?

185
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,564
You don't think
I told them that already?

186
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,166
Well, then, tell them again.

187
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:40,951
Okay, we got
no DNA match.

188
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:42,235
We got no surveillance video.

189
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:43,837
There's one way
we're gonna find the shooter.

190
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,338
If their patient--
my victim-- tells us

191
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,140
who the hell was trying
to hunt him down

192
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:48,842
like an animal
in the street last night.

193
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:51,128
I will tell them that...
as soon as I'm off hold.

194
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,080
Great. You at least get a name
on the victim?

195
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:55,132
Carl Patrick.

196
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:57,134
Good. Can you run him?

197
00:06:57,136 --> 00:06:59,886
No, I didn't run him.
I just got it.

198
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:01,688
Can you give me a break, please?

199
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,107
Kick him in the shins, Jackie,
like I used to.

200
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:05,108
Hey, Erin.

201
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,593
Hey.

202
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:07,611
What are you doing here?

203
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:09,529
It's nice to see you,
too, Daniel.

204
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:12,315
It's been a tough
one, okay? Forgive me.

205
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:14,201
I heard. How are you doing?

206
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:15,152
I'm fine.

207
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:16,820
Fine. You look fine.

208
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:19,122
What brings you down here?

209
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,491
Took a statement off
a robbery collar downstairs.

210
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:23,226
Buy you a cup of coffee?

211
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,280
Yes.

212
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,500
I'll be back.

213
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:33,303
Mm-hmm.

214
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:38,725
I'm sorry. He's in a meeting.
May I take a message?

215
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:39,843
He in?

216
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:41,561
No, he's with you.

217
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:44,130
Baker, one of us needs glasses.

218
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:46,149
He said he was going down
to your office.

219
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:48,018
I haven't seen him all day.

220
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:54,808
It's Detective Baker
in the commissioner's office.

221
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,610
You got a 20 on the PC?

222
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:58,812
Okay, thank you.

223
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:01,114
The commissioner
has left the building.

224
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:04,317
Let me ask you
a question, Erin.

225
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,837
When did you become a
supervisor in the DA's office?

226
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,004
A couple of years ago. Why?

227
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:09,706
No. It was
three years ago.

228
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,042
In those three years,
how many times

229
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:14,828
you come down to the
squad to take a statement

230
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,013
from a D felony
robbery collar?

231
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:18,265
You never done it.

232
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:19,999
So, what's going on now, huh?

233
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,636
What, did Linda tell you
to come talk to me?

234
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:24,554
No, she didn't.
Okay, she just told me

235
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:26,189
what was going on
between you guys.

236
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:28,191
I thought maybe I could help.
We're fine.

237
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:29,860
Danny...
We're fine!

238
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:32,896
Okay, you're not fine,
and even if you were, <i>she's</i> not.

239
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:35,532
Look, do you really want in
the middle of this right now?

240
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:36,650
I'm your sister.

241
00:08:36,652 --> 00:08:38,451
Yeah, and you should
know more than anyone

242
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:41,488
that if someone takes a shot at
my family, I'm taking him out.

243
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,906
End of discussion.
Danny, I know.

244
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:45,692
Okay, but you need to look
at it from her perspective.

245
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:48,078
Those were her babies
in the back of that car.

246
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,579
They're my babies, too.

247
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:53,199
I know, but you're a cop, okay.

248
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:54,801
You're used
to bullets flying around.

249
00:08:54,803 --> 00:08:57,254
She's just a mom out there.

250
00:08:57,256 --> 00:08:58,922
(phone ringing)

251
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:01,091
And I'm a dad out there.

252
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,593
Yeah?

253
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:05,478
Something came up
you're not gonna like.

254
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,564
The guy you ran over--
he's a resident

255
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:09,733
at the halfway house
in your hood.

256
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:10,851
What, he's an ex-con?

257
00:09:10,853 --> 00:09:13,052
Uh, released from prison
last week.

258
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,105
Well, was it a hit?
Is he a mob guy? What?

259
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:16,940
Worse. He's a child molester.

260
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:20,660
(sighs)

261
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:23,530
Unbelievable.

262
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,380
(elevator bell dings)

263
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:42,582
(elevator doors open)

264
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:48,021
(elevator doors close)

265
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:50,624
Shouldn't I know you?

266
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:53,426
I don't think so.

267
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,695
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

268
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:13,880
I was working at a boys
soccer camp Upstate when I...

269
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:16,049
Look, I'm not proud
of what I did,

270
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:18,051
but I'm better now.

271
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:19,986
I got help inside.

272
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,171
I'm healed.

273
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:23,456
Yeah? And what about Wyatt?

274
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,125
The little boy you raped--
you think he's better now?

275
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:28,061
You think he's all healed?

276
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:31,848
I don't expect you
to understand.

277
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,132
I don't understand.

278
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,769
But I paid my debt to society.

279
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:36,903
Yeah, well,
someone out there thinks

280
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:38,021
you shouldn't have your life,

281
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:39,239
and I can't say
I disagree with him.

282
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:41,358
Now,

283
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,610
you said you believed
that the guy chasing you around

284
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:45,946
with a gun last night was
this boy Wyatt's dad.

285
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:47,247
Bruce Richmond, yeah.

286
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:48,581
Bruce Richmond.
But you also said,

287
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,983
when you left
the halfway house,

288
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:52,452
you saw someone come chasing up
behind you with a mask on.

289
00:10:52,454 --> 00:10:54,487
So, how can you be sure
it was Bruce Richmond?

290
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:57,507
Every day I was in prison,
he sent me a letter,

291
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:00,543
saying he was going to kill me
when I was released.

292
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:01,494
Mm-hmm.

293
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:03,346
This morning, he sent those.

294
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:09,536
DANNY:
"Time's up. Love, Bruce."

295
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:18,299
Oh, I think it stinks.

296
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,574
Being a public figure?

297
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:23,910
I would think you're used
to being recognized.

298
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:26,212
I don't think I'll ever
get used to it.

299
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:28,164
Or accept it.

300
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,250
You've been a cop all your life.

301
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:32,919
Cops aren't public figures.

302
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:34,587
They're public servants.

303
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:38,007
And I'm not a cop anymore,
I'm a civilian employee.

304
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:39,642
When I became
police commissioner,

305
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:42,479
I had to resign from the NYPD.

306
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,714
How do you feel
about not being a cop.

307
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:47,066
I miss it.

308
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:49,536
That's a lot to handle
in five years.

309
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:52,806
You lost your wife,
you lost being a cop,

310
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:56,176
to become commissioner,
then you lost your son.

311
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:57,944
This isn't about that.

312
00:11:57,946 --> 00:11:59,812
If you say so.

313
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:02,916
That's not why I'm here.

314
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:04,701
Why are you here?

315
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:08,288
You tell me.

316
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,774
Sorry, doesn't work that way.

317
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:16,613
You under a lot
of stress lately?

318
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,002
What I meant,
as I think you well know,

319
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:26,773
was: are you dealing
with more stress than usual?

320
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:28,975
Well, let's see.

321
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:32,678
We have a rapist targeting
teenage school girls,

322
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,815
unexplained rapid rise
in subway crime,

323
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:38,485
and another threat level
increase out of D.C.

324
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:40,703
No, no more stress than usual.

325
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:43,740
Have you tried
any sleep medication?

326
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:45,158
We don't do that.

327
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,827
Who doesn't do what?

328
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:49,963
Reagans don't take drugs.

329
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:52,165
Oh.

330
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:56,052
Is there anything else
Reagans don't do?

331
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:58,488
This.

332
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:02,725
Frank, you are
an intelligent man,

333
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,727
and I have no doubts

334
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:07,480
you are capable
of successfully

335
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:11,384
deflecting any of my questions
for as long as you wish,

336
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:14,737
but in 20 minutes,
your hour will be up,

337
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:18,441
as I suspect you
will be tonight.

338
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,731
Where were you on 9/11?

339
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:28,952
Here in the city.

340
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:31,371
Where were you when
the first tower came down?

341
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:35,625
I was sitting in this chair.

342
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:41,414
Everybody remembers where
they were at that exact moment.

343
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:47,520
Where were you, Frank?

344
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:51,608
I was in the North Tower.

345
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:11,794
This isn't gonna work.

346
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,017
(children laughing in distance)

347
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,169
"Time's up. Love, Bruce."

348
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:21,471
You write that?

349
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:23,806
I did.

350
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:25,091
Black roses?

351
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:26,476
(sniffs)

352
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:29,145
Two years ago, you obtained
a premise permit for a 9mm.

353
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:30,296
You still own that gun?

354
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:31,981
It's in my closet.

355
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:33,766
You understand anything you say

356
00:14:33,768 --> 00:14:35,435
can be used against
you, right Bruce?

357
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,587
(kids shouting playfully)

358
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:42,942
BRUCE:
Wyatt used to love it here.

359
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:45,445
Every morning,

360
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:46,946
I'd bring him out here.

361
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:49,165
Then again right after school.

362
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:50,767
Now look at him.

363
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:56,155
He begged and begged us
to send him to soccer camp,

364
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:58,174
but his mother wouldn't have it.

365
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:01,761
I always said she was
too overprotective.

366
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:06,849
"What harm could... one
week could do?" I said.

367
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,386
I'm gonna need you
to roll up your sleeve

368
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,689
and let me take a look
at your right arm, Bruce.

369
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:16,726
Maybe I should talk
to that lawyer.

370
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:22,014
Look, my heart aches
for you and your family.

371
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:24,701
Honestly, it does, Bruce.

372
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:26,519
But if that was you last night,

373
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:28,521
then you took a shot
at my family.

374
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:32,408
So, I'm gonna ask you
right now, was it you?

375
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:38,331
I read about the
shooting in the paper;

376
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,584
I wanted that son of a
bitch to think it was me.

377
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:45,505
Wish I had the balls.

378
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:49,225
(sighs)

379
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:51,144
JACKIE:
Well?

380
00:15:51,146 --> 00:15:52,729
It's not the guy.

381
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:54,063
Huh, you look relieved.

382
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:56,766
You know what, as bad as I want
to nail this son of a bitch,

383
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:58,384
the last thing in the
world I really wanted

384
00:15:58,386 --> 00:16:00,386
was for Bruce Richmond to
be that son of a bitch.

385
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:02,772
The poor guy.
Heartbreaker, huh?

386
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:04,657
The worst.

387
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,743
All right, why don't
we start over, okay?

388
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:08,828
Walk it through from the
beginning, see where we're at.

389
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,196
Well, I was thinking,
why don't we

390
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:11,581
just take a ride
to Staten Island?

391
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,565
What do you mean, Staten Island?

392
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,450
What if Carl Patrick
got into a beef

393
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:17,570
with one of the other cons
inside the halfway house?

394
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:19,789
Or someone
outside the halfway house.

395
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:22,508
Good thinking, partner;
we should go.

396
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,632
BAKER: Where were you?
Urgent police business.

397
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:31,134
I've been looking
all over for you.

398
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:33,352
We've been trying to cover...
Thank you, Baker. Carry on.

399
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:35,921
Where have you been?

400
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:37,857
Mrs. Reagan.
You've gained some weight.

401
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,275
You left without telling anyone.

402
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:40,309
I went out.

403
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:41,778
I can do that,
you know, Garrett.

404
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,029
Not without your
detail, you cant.

405
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:45,481
I looked both ways
before crossing the street,

406
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:46,783
and I didn't talk to strangers.

407
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:47,700
Where's your pin?

408
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:50,703
In my pocket.

409
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,038
Frank?

410
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,573
Your spin is not necessary here.

411
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:55,374
My spin is not all
I'm good for, Frank.

412
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:56,409
I know that.

413
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:58,611
Look, you're talking to a guy

414
00:16:58,613 --> 00:16:59,962
who's on wife number three.

415
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:02,582
I know how the start
of an affair can be

416
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:04,467
logistically challenging.

417
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:07,887
Boy.

418
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:10,006
I never could get one past you.

419
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:12,391
I can help you.

420
00:17:12,393 --> 00:17:14,010
Going forward, I can

421
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:16,345
put out your schedule in ways
that won't raise any questions.

422
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:19,148
Thanks, Garrett, but I'm
not sure it is going forward.

423
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,733
Oh, sorry to hear that.

424
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,819
What can you do?

425
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:28,974
Just curious-- why not?

426
00:17:28,976 --> 00:17:30,359
Too young? Too old?

427
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:33,279
More like the type that asks
too many questions.

428
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:36,148
Been there.

429
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,117
Baker...

430
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,585
where were we?

431
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:40,870
(door closes)

432
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:42,872
CROWD (chanting):
Halfway, no way!

433
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:46,042
Our neighbors have been going at
it like this for about a month

434
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:48,160
ever since they turned this
joint into a halfway house.

435
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:50,463
I got to tell you, Reagan,
I got kids,

436
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:52,632
and they put murderers
and molesters next door to me?

437
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:54,166
I'd be right out there
with them.

438
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:56,052
You and my wife both.

439
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:59,288
Well, there's nothing like
a mother protecting her young.

440
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:02,558
Halfway, no way!

441
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,811
So how is she?

442
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:07,396
(sighs)

443
00:18:07,398 --> 00:18:09,132
All right.

444
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:13,119
So you really think one
of your neighbors here

445
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:14,237
is the shooter?

446
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,571
I don't know.

447
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:17,990
Crime's up ten percent since
they opened this place.

448
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:19,709
Look at them.

449
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,911
They've clearly had enough.

450
00:18:21,913 --> 00:18:23,579
Staten Island, you know,

451
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:25,688
not exactly known
for turning the other cheek.

452
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:26,250
Mm.

453
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:28,835
Yeah, well, why don't we
swing by the local precinct.

454
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:30,753
See if any sector car
took any complaints.

455
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:33,089
(phone ringing)
Good idea.

456
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,974
Hold on.

457
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:36,876
Hey.

458
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:38,878
O-Okay, slow down, slow down.

459
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,263
What happened?

460
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:42,431
He what?

461
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,884
Okay, I'm, I'm on my way.

462
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:46,152
All right.

463
00:18:46,154 --> 00:18:47,603
What happened?

464
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,488
(car starts)

465
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,657
Hey.

466
00:18:54,494 --> 00:18:56,061
How's Jack?

467
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:57,246
He's okay; he's fine.

468
00:18:57,248 --> 00:18:58,998
What do you mean, he's okay?
You said he was crying.

469
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,750
He came home from school;
he never comes home from school.

470
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:02,285
He just, he wanted to come home.

471
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:04,871
Because of last night?

472
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:06,923
Yeah.

473
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:09,258
The nurse said that
he just keeps...

474
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,128
seeing the flash from the gun.

475
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:21,871
(exhales)

476
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:44,744
Always point it in
a safe direction.

477
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:45,969
Number two?

478
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:50,494
Never touch the trigger
unless you're ready to shoot.

479
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:52,412
And rule number three?

480
00:19:52,414 --> 00:19:54,815
Assume every gun is loaded.

481
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:56,250
That's right.

482
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:03,690
I was just a little bit
younger than you

483
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:06,059
the first time my dad
let me hold his gun.

484
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,097
But he trusted me
to be responsible and safe.

485
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:12,049
The same way I'm trusting you.

486
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:13,517
You understand?

487
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,935
(quietly):
Yeah.

488
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:16,637
Okay?
Mm.

489
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:17,804
All right.

490
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:19,306
Chamber's empty.

491
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:20,674
Gun's clean.

492
00:20:20,676 --> 00:20:23,810
Okay.
Give me your hand.

493
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:27,147
Get your thumb under
there, right there.

494
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:28,532
Watch the trigger.

495
00:20:28,534 --> 00:20:30,534
Keep your finger outside
the trigger guard.

496
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:32,319
Support it with your other hand.

497
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:34,554
Keep it aimed down.
Okay.

498
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:36,837
Down is safe 'cause no
one's below us right now.

499
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:38,709
All right?

500
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:48,552
It's kind of heavy.

501
00:20:48,554 --> 00:20:49,869
Yeah, it's heavy.

502
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:52,489
It's not a toy.

503
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:58,712
Jack, what you saw
the other night...

504
00:20:58,714 --> 00:21:01,682
There are times in life

505
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:03,850
when you're gonna have
to stand up for yourself.

506
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:07,638
You're gonna have to defend
yourself and your family.

507
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:13,610
I'm so sorry you
had to see that.

508
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,997
But you did.

509
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:21,535
You gonna be all right?

510
00:21:21,537 --> 00:21:23,253
Yeah.

511
00:21:23,255 --> 00:21:25,339
What's going on?

512
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:26,740
Hey.

513
00:21:26,742 --> 00:21:28,675
Jack, give that back
to Daddy right now.

514
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:29,909
Linda, it's fine.

515
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:30,961
You heard me, Jack.

516
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:32,245
It's all right.

517
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:33,930
Go on upstairs.

518
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:35,265
Go ahead.

519
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:37,417
(gun clicks)

520
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:43,423
Linda, he was afraid.

521
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:44,691
He was curious.

522
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:46,259
He asked if he could see it.

523
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:47,477
So you said yes.

524
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,812
It's time.

525
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:50,781
Two days after he's almost shot

526
00:21:50,783 --> 00:21:54,284
is-is time for him to play
with your gun?

527
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:55,986
He wasn't playing
with it, Linda.

528
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:58,572
I'm teaching him about it.

529
00:21:58,574 --> 00:22:02,442
Look, we-we can either
make him a part of it

530
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:04,828
with my supervision,
or we can wait.

531
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,380
We can wait until him
and his kid brother

532
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:07,447
are snooping around
in the closet

533
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:08,448
one day when we're not home,

534
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,416
and then God forbid.

535
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:11,218
Those are wonderful
options, Danny.

536
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,589
Look... the biggest
mistake we can make

537
00:22:15,591 --> 00:22:19,142
is to pretend that my gun
does not exist in this house.

538
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:37,994
Okay. Listen to this.

539
00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:40,414
Cops at the 1-2-5
took a robbery complaint

540
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,365
just three hours
before the shooting.

541
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:43,667
Oh, what do we got here?

542
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:45,619
An irate father threatening
to kill somebody

543
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:47,337
after a 16-year-old girl
was held up

544
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:48,455
at gunpoint for an iPhone?

545
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:49,756
What's the connection?
Keep going.

546
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:51,541
Why would a guy pissed off
about a robbery

547
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:53,159
want to hunt down Carl Patrick?

548
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:54,828
Look at the description
she gave of the perp.

549
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,597
Six-two, male, white,
reddish hair.

550
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,633
That's Carl Patrick to a tee.
What do we got here?

551
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:01,167
A case of mistaken identity?

552
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:04,104
Well, I'm thinking the guy's in
such a rage that he goes after

553
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:06,389
the first person he sees coming
out of that halfway house

554
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:08,007
that fits the description.

555
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:09,309
(tapping on computer keys)

556
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:10,710
Come on, give me a name.

557
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,365
Unbelievable.

558
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:16,566
I know this schmuck.

559
00:23:16,568 --> 00:23:17,851
A friend of yours?

560
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:19,619
No. Our boys were on the same
football team together,

561
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:21,187
that is,
until he yelled at my son,

562
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,405
and we almost came to blows.

563
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:24,991
Oh, so this
should be fun.

564
00:23:24,993 --> 00:23:27,294
(thud, grunts)
Come on, harder, harder.

565
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:28,295
Square your shoulders up.

566
00:23:28,297 --> 00:23:29,913
I can't.
I'm sorry.

567
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:31,197
I don't know
the meaning of that word.

568
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:32,699
Come on, let's go.

569
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:33,650
Be a man.

570
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:35,535
There!

571
00:23:35,537 --> 00:23:36,970
Welcome to the NFL.

572
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:38,004
Come on, get up.

573
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:39,923
Hey, Wayne.
How's it going?

574
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:40,974
Reagan?

575
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:43,927
This is my partner,
Detective Curatola.

576
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:46,263
I see Dylan still
hits like a bull.

577
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:48,715
Yeah, well,
practice, practice, practice.

578
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:50,567
Uh-huh.
You got a second?

579
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:53,219
Go on, take a blow.

580
00:23:54,772 --> 00:23:56,055
What's up?

581
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:57,357
We understand
your daughter

582
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,392
was the victim
of a crime the other day.

583
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:01,661
Yeah. Jennifer.

584
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:03,229
One of those
halfway house dirtbags

585
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:04,564
mugged her
right on Richmond Avenue.

586
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:06,249
I'm sorry to hear
about that.

587
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:08,251
She did get a good look
at the guy though, right?

588
00:24:08,253 --> 00:24:09,953
I thought you worked
in Manhattan.

589
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:11,905
What? You get bumped down
to Staten Island now?

590
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:13,456
I take a special
interest in cases

591
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,574
close to home, you know?

592
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:16,242
Yeah. Well, what do you
want to know?

593
00:24:16,244 --> 00:24:18,428
I-I already told the cops down
at the precinct everything.

594
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,213
Yeah, sure you did.
We just want to know

595
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:22,048
if you or Jennifer
have seen the guy since.

596
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:22,916
No.

597
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:25,352
No? You didn't
go after him,

598
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:26,553
go looking for him?

599
00:24:26,555 --> 00:24:27,754
Try to find him?

600
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:29,088
Yeah, well, you told the cops
down at the station

601
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,257
you were gonna find him
yourself.

602
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:32,392
How'd that work out for you?

603
00:24:32,394 --> 00:24:35,529
No. No, I, uh, had something
to do that night.

604
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:38,231
Mm-hmm. What'd you have
to do that night?

605
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,316
Dinner.

606
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:42,319
Dinner? Where'd you go,
locally, restaurant?

607
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:43,904
HOLLIE: No, it was
here at home.

608
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:45,922
Hello, Hollie.

609
00:24:45,924 --> 00:24:47,657
Hey, Danny. How's Linda?

610
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:48,792
She's good.

611
00:24:48,794 --> 00:24:51,278
Will you tell her
that I said hello?

612
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,495
I will.

613
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:55,081
So, Mrs. Rivano, you had,
uh, dinner here on Sunday?

614
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:55,966
That's right.

615
00:24:55,968 --> 00:24:57,334
And who was here with you?

616
00:24:57,336 --> 00:24:58,568
The kids.

617
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:01,254
Anyone besides a family member

618
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:02,789
who could
corroborate your story?

619
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,140
Corroborate my story?

620
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:06,125
We're just trying to sort out
what happened that night.

621
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:08,845
Yeah, well, one of those animals
from the halfway house

622
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:10,129
stuck a gun
in my daughter's back.

623
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:10,931
That's what happened.

624
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:15,068
Yeah, told us that already.

625
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,353
Do you own a gun, Wayne?

626
00:25:17,605 --> 00:25:19,573
What's going on here, Danny?

627
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:21,307
Do we need to call a lawyer?

628
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:23,326
I don't know, Hollie.

629
00:25:23,328 --> 00:25:25,428
Wayne, do you need a lawyer?

630
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:28,531
You know what?

631
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:30,283
This conversation is over.

632
00:25:30,285 --> 00:25:32,035
Get the hell off my lawn.

633
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:34,037
As you wish.

634
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,156
Well, if it walks like a duck,
talks like a duck...

635
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:39,659
Must be a duck.

636
00:25:44,131 --> 00:25:46,116
ERIN:
<i>But I'd have to prove it,</i>

637
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:46,883
which I can't.

638
00:25:46,885 --> 00:25:47,968
Not with what I got,

639
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,969
which is nothing.

640
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:51,054
It's just a warrant.

641
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:53,172
Let me run his DNA
against the blood

642
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:54,340
I found at the crime scene.

643
00:25:54,342 --> 00:25:55,525
I promise you it'll match.

644
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:56,509
Based on what?

645
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,344
Based on he took a shot
at my kids.

646
00:25:58,346 --> 00:25:59,446
Your nephews.

647
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:01,648
That is a low blow,
even for you.

648
00:26:03,451 --> 00:26:06,036
(sighs)
You're right. I'm sorry.

649
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:07,320
Can I get the warrant?

650
00:26:07,322 --> 00:26:08,872
I'm sorry.

651
00:26:16,297 --> 00:26:17,547
(slams shopping cart)

652
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:20,083
Hey, Hollie,
nice to see you.

653
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:23,253
I wish I could
say the same.

654
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:26,890
One phone call from
your father-in-law,

655
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:28,541
that's all it
would have taken

656
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,310
to shut down that
damn halfway house.

657
00:26:30,312 --> 00:26:31,544
I'm sorry, you know,

658
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:32,762
but that's not exactly true.

659
00:26:32,764 --> 00:26:34,347
You Reagans...

660
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:37,400
you-you walk around like you're
big shots, but when it's time

661
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:39,218
for you to put that
big name of yours to use,

662
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,219
you don't lift a finger.

663
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:41,521
You know what, Hollie?

664
00:26:41,523 --> 00:26:44,190
I don't have a clue
what you're talking about,

665
00:26:44,192 --> 00:26:47,060
but, as usual, it just sounds
like a bunch of trash.

666
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:47,944
Excuse me.

667
00:26:47,946 --> 00:26:49,195
You think you're so much better

668
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:50,413
than the rest of us, don't cha?

669
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:52,415
No, Hollie. Just you.

670
00:26:54,902 --> 00:26:56,786
You tell your husband
the next time he steps foot

671
00:26:56,788 --> 00:26:59,255
on my property,
he'd better have a warrant.

672
00:26:59,257 --> 00:27:01,191
Or a Swat team.

673
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:11,685
It's 4:00 in the morning, Pop.

674
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:14,087
You should be asleep.

675
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:16,606
I was about to tell
you the same thing.

676
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,692
I know you were.

677
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:21,661
I got a full day
tomorrow.

678
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:22,645
Knock it off.

679
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:26,232
We live in a
hundred-year-old house.

680
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:30,487
You think I haven't heard you
working the floor every night?

681
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:36,459
Francis...

682
00:27:36,461 --> 00:27:38,862
why do you still wear
your wedding band?

683
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:42,799
Old habit.

684
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:45,284
Mary got sick.

685
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:46,603
That wasn't your fault.

686
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:48,588
Pop, you sound like a shrink.

687
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,841
It wasn't your fault
when the mayor offered you

688
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:54,344
the PC job a month
later either.

689
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:56,730
The department needed
you to step up.

690
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:58,648
She wanted me to take the job.

691
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,633
You never told me that.

692
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:04,437
What she didn't want
was her youngest

693
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:06,139
joining the family business.

694
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:09,409
Oh, yeah, she was so proud
when he graduated law.

695
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:10,927
And relieved.

696
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:15,815
Francis, that was
Jamie's choice.

697
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:20,170
Well, I still see it as my job
to worry for both of us.

698
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,376
When Tom Costello
took that bullet

699
00:28:26,378 --> 00:28:29,546
standing next to you,
how'd you feel?

700
00:28:31,515 --> 00:28:34,768
Every cop's worst nightmare:

701
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,687
their partner dying
in their arms.

702
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:40,523
Did you ever ask yourself,
why him and not me?

703
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:42,692
Every day.

704
00:28:42,694 --> 00:28:47,230
Was there a moment
you were glad it wasn't you?

705
00:28:50,451 --> 00:28:53,536
John McKenna's not doing well.

706
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:57,907
Oh...

707
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:01,845
You guys went through
a lot together.

708
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:05,548
Competed
for different promotions.

709
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,868
I lost touch.

710
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,405
I hadn't seen him
since he went on disability.

711
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:18,978
We were side by side
in the North Tower.

712
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,515
When the South Tower went,
we just looked at each other,

713
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:25,351
and we knew that twice
as many people were trapped

714
00:29:25,353 --> 00:29:28,688
above the impact
in our building.

715
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:32,475
(sighs)

716
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:39,999
We lost almost 3,000 that day,
but it's not over.

717
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:43,803
People are still dying.

718
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,209
Son...

719
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,927
(sighs)

720
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:52,929
I don't know why Chief McKenna

721
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:57,717
got sick from the air
down there, and you didn't.

722
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,252
Just like I don't know why

723
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:02,989
he took Mary and Joe
from us too soon.

724
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:11,231
But I see God's light
in this family every day.

725
00:30:13,017 --> 00:30:18,254
And though I may
not understand it...

726
00:30:18,256 --> 00:30:21,524
I trust in His plan for us all.

727
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:47,781
LINDA: Heavenly Father,
we thank you for this food

728
00:30:47,782 --> 00:30:51,550
we are about to receive, for the
love that you show our family

729
00:30:52,795 --> 00:30:54,570
and for the wisdom

730
00:30:54,571 --> 00:30:59,090
that you grant us in making
the right decisions. Amen.

731
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:00,942
OTHERS: Amen.

732
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,862
What a beautiful blessing, Aunt Linda.
Really nice.

733
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,264
Yeah, especially the bit there

734
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:07,815
at the end about making
the right decisions.

735
00:31:07,817 --> 00:31:10,201
I'm just saying
grace, Danny.

736
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:12,320
Yeah, and Erin's
potatoes aren't soggy.

737
00:31:12,322 --> 00:31:13,604
Beg your pardon?

738
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,957
Everything all right down there?

739
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,292
Everything's fine, Gramps.

740
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:20,161
Fine, my ass.
You two still fighting?

741
00:31:20,163 --> 00:31:21,334
Could we talk about this
another time, please?

742
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,559
You brought it up.

743
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:28,419
Grandpa never misses
family dinner.

744
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:29,921
Why isn't he here?

745
00:31:29,923 --> 00:31:32,090
Well, he just said that
something came up,

746
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:34,309
and he didn't have time
to explain, that's all.

747
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,762
I'm waiting, Detective.

748
00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:39,647
Honestly, Gramps,
it's nothing.

749
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:43,268
Just because your father
isn't here doesn't mean...

750
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,938
that the rules have changed.

751
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,690
Everything has been fair game

752
00:31:48,692 --> 00:31:50,608
at the Reagan
family dinner table.

753
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,193
Always has been. Always will be.

754
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,330
Yeah.

755
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:58,833
So... what's going on?

756
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:01,252
Well, Linda wants me
to drop the case.

757
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:02,754
I didn't ask you
to drop the case.

758
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:04,372
I asked you to hand it off.

759
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:05,373
Same difference.

760
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,708
No, it's not.

761
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,161
Oh, great, you're
lawyered up now.

762
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:11,596
No, she didn't
lawyer up.

763
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,214
I just happen to
agree with her.

764
00:32:13,216 --> 00:32:14,382
Oh.

765
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:17,635
Danny, no one wants this
guy who shot at our kids

766
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:19,170
nailed to a wall more than I do,

767
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:21,723
but, you know, this is just--
this is too much.

768
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:23,007
It's too close to home.

769
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,642
What, is there 300 other
first-grade detectives

770
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:25,893
who could take the case?

771
00:32:25,895 --> 00:32:28,229
Yeah, but none of 'em are
as good as Uncle Danny is.

772
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:29,680
Nicky.

773
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:31,232
I'm sorry,
but it's what I think.

774
00:32:31,234 --> 00:32:32,283
Thank you.

775
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:34,118
Isn't that another rule
at family dinner?

776
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,070
Everybody's opinion counts.

777
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:37,855
That's right.

778
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:39,040
It's my opinion, too.

779
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:40,858
Danny's the best we got.

780
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,093
You got to let him
see it through.

781
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:51,085
You know, I...

782
00:32:51,087 --> 00:32:54,505
I'm done playing second fiddle
to the NYPD.

783
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,519
FRANK: <i>The only thing harder</i>
<i>than being a cop</i>

784
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:11,906
is being married to one.

785
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:15,643
What'd you used to say
about Danny?

786
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:19,714
He is cursed
with the gift for the job.

787
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:24,202
I'll tell you this,
he's got the Reagan temper.

788
00:33:24,204 --> 00:33:26,804
Yeah, I know, now that
I'm a big-time diplomat,

789
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:28,339
I got to sit
on mine,

790
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:33,127
but... I see myself
in Danny every day...

791
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:38,049
...and it makes me proud.

792
00:33:38,051 --> 00:33:41,703
Worry about Erin-- the divorce.

793
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:42,804
(sighs)

794
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:46,274
Raising kids by yourself
can be rough...

795
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:51,345
and daughters are special...
as you well know.

796
00:33:53,315 --> 00:33:55,283
Oh, here's one for you:

797
00:33:55,285 --> 00:34:00,204
my youngest,
my Harvard lawyer is a cop--

798
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:03,307
something Mary didn't want.

799
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:10,781
John, I'm sorry
I haven't been around for you.

800
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:15,169
When you went out
on three-quarters, I...

801
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,258
I'm not gonna blame it
on the job.

802
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,429
(sighs)

803
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:27,098
Life plays tricks on you.

804
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,051
(footfalls,
door opening)

805
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,975
(sighs)

806
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:45,283
Bye, old friend.

807
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,852
(sobbing)

808
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,578
(garbage truck stopping)

809
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,221
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

810
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:41,556
This belong to that house?

811
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:42,873
Yeah.
Okay, great, know what?

812
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,759
Leave it with me,
I'll take care of it.

813
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:45,927
All right?

814
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,486
Hey!
You stay right there, all right?

815
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:57,822
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Reagan?

816
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,106
I said don't move.

817
00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:00,858
Get the hell out of my trash.

818
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,410
You leave trash out on the curb,

819
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,946
and it can be searched
without a warrant,

820
00:36:04,948 --> 00:36:05,947
Wayne.

821
00:36:05,949 --> 00:36:07,515
I'm calling
a lawyer.

822
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:09,450
You go do that.

823
00:36:09,452 --> 00:36:10,418
What are you gonna do with that?

824
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,502
I'm gonna lift the DNA off it

825
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:12,837
and match it to the blood

826
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,172
you left at the crime scene
when I shot you in your arm.

827
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:16,541
You're out of your mind.

828
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:19,260
I'm out of my mind?

829
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,380
You say I'm out of my mind?

830
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:24,348
Hey, take it easy, all right?
You could have killed my kids,

831
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,633
and I'm out of my mind?
Hey.

832
00:36:25,635 --> 00:36:27,134
Take it easy, would you,
Reagan, all right?

833
00:36:27,136 --> 00:36:28,686
What's the matter?

834
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:30,137
Not so tough
without your mask?

835
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:31,472
I didn't do it,
all right?

836
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:32,857
Good, prove it.

837
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:34,592
Come on, roll
up your sleeve.

838
00:36:34,594 --> 00:36:35,375
Just listen to me.

839
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,275
I'll give you three seconds
to roll up your sleeve.

840
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,529
Ho, ho, ho,
just take it easy.

841
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:39,730
Three...
Listen to me.

842
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:41,282
Two...
All right, all right, all right.

843
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:42,850
One!
All, all right.

844
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,776
This is for my family.

845
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:55,663
(screaming)

846
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,384
You have the right
to remain silent.

847
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:03,638
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

848
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,856
in a court of law.

849
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:22,990
I still remember the first time
I saw you in your dress blues.

850
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:34,919
That was outside
of Pizza Amore.

851
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:39,657
Yeah... and you were
in trouble with me, then, too.

852
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:42,910
Why do you think I
wore the uniform?

853
00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:52,553
Now I only ever
see you in it

854
00:37:52,555 --> 00:37:55,356
when we're going
to a funeral.

855
00:37:56,141 --> 00:38:00,027
I was going to
wait till later...

856
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,148
...to give this
to you, but...

857
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,033
What is that?

858
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:08,202
Open it.

859
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,915
Danny.

860
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:25,052
I love being a cop, Linda--

861
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:29,006
it's always been more
than a job to me--

862
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:32,560
but nothing on this planet
is more important to me

863
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:34,729
than you and those boys.

864
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:40,501
(sighs)

865
00:38:40,503 --> 00:38:42,520
I do not want you
to stop being a cop.

866
00:38:42,522 --> 00:38:46,357
I just need you to
know that I would.

867
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:53,564
(sighs)

868
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,542
Oh, Danny.

869
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,263
I love you.

870
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:11,432
I love you more.

871
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,519
(bagpipes playing
"Amazing Grace" inside church)

872
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:36,741
Where were you on 9/11?

873
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:42,446
That question has become
part of the fabric

874
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:44,799
of our lives
as Americans.

875
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:49,804
On 9/11, I was with a hero.

876
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,056
I was with John McKenna.

877
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,729
On that beautiful,
cloudless morning

878
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:02,800
that seemed to promise
nothing but goodness,

879
00:40:02,802 --> 00:40:05,135
John and his dear wife Molly

880
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:07,471
were about to pull
out of the driveway

881
00:40:07,473 --> 00:40:12,076
for a much-needed
and long-overdue vacation,

882
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:16,413
but when news of the attack came
over the radio...

883
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:20,885
...they both knew
that Montauk would have to wait.

884
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:26,423
Molly kissed him good-bye,
urged him to be careful,

885
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:32,129
as she had done every day
for the almost 30 years...

886
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:37,218
that he served and protected
this city.

887
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:41,555
And then John headed
for Ground Zero.

888
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:47,228
Where were you on 9/11?

889
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:53,033
On September 11, 2001,

890
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:57,238
John McKenna saved
more than 100 lives.

891
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,662
You see this?

892
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:08,532
It's worn by
the first responders that day.

893
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,887
John could wear it as proudly

894
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:15,055
as anyone who was there.

895
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,831
Why them and not me?

896
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:29,737
As a cop, I've asked myself
that question...

897
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:32,857
many times.

898
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,076
But I have come to realize

899
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:40,414
that just about...
any New Yorker...

900
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:44,518
...could ask themselves
the same question.

901
00:41:46,054 --> 00:41:51,258
And some questions
have no answers.

902
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,015
(sniffs)

903
00:41:58,017 --> 00:42:01,101
All that is left
for we, the living, to do

904
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:05,556
is honor them,
take care of them...

905
00:42:05,558 --> 00:42:07,024
(sighs)

906
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:11,946
...and rededicate ourselves
to the cause for which they gave

907
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:16,617
the last full measure
of devotion.

908
00:42:19,988 --> 00:42:22,223
FRANK: <i>John...</i>

909
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:28,111
<i>...may the road rise up</i>
<i>to meet you.</i>

910
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:31,749
<i>May the wind be always</i>
<i>at your back.</i>

911
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:35,169
<i>May the sun shine warm</i>
<i>upon your face,</i>

912
00:42:35,171 --> 00:42:39,256
<i>the rains fall soft</i>
<i>upon your fields,</i>

913
00:42:39,258 --> 00:42:42,343
<i>and until we meet again,</i>

914
00:42:42,345 --> 00:42:46,296
<i>may God hold you</i>
<i>in the palm of his hand.</i>

915
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:54,485
