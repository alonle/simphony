I ate all the cookie dough
toppings a man could want.

139
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:35,574
So many cookies
will never be born.

140
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,643

all that matters is,

141

154
00:07:29,594 --> 00:07:31,462
You left some big underpants

155
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:33,964
I didn't know they made
Underoos in size 52.

156

They're called
Superoos, son.

More like <i>The Expandables.</i>
(chuckles)

159
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:44,542
Why didn't you
strangle me?

160
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:47,778
That kind of small-scale
violence solves nothing.

161
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:49,280
Couldn't agree more.

162
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:50,881

crusted with Cheeto dust.

164
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:01,525
Uh, I'll pass
on the pork.

165
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,060

166
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:09,333

beans with slivered almonds.

167
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:11,969
Mmm, so slivered.

168
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:14,004
Mmm.

169
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:20,945
(quietly): Bart, why is the dad I always
wished for creeping me out?

170
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,548
I don't know. 'Cause you're

174
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:30,955
A napkin.

00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:49,774
Can I just get a glass of water?

180
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:52,276
Water? That stuff killed
my grandmother.

181
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,979
So sad.

182
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:01,886
I've been having

183
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,155
snuggle dreams.

184
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:07,158
Marge, I changed in Boise.

185
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:10,161
I'm not sure a man
who eats right and doesn't drink

186
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,562
can be good in bed.

187
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:13,998
Well, what made you...?
You're so beautiful

188
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:17,168
when I cut you off in
the middle of a question.

189
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,436
(both moaning)

190
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:22,940
(gasps)
Oh. Oh, my.

191
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,742
What's that thing
you're doing?

192
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:27,178
HOMER (sultrily):
Moving my body.

193
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:29,680
MARGE (chuckling):
Oh.

194
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:33,250
(humming happily)

195
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:35,886
Don't you think it's weird
that Dad stopped eating pork

196
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:37,321
<i>and</i> drinking beer?

197
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:38,823
Who cares
what happened?

198
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:40,357
Daddy's back.

199
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:42,126
(grunts)

200
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:44,962
(humming happily)

201
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:56,574
Something happened to Dad
on that trip.

202
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,409
This is worse than when he went
to New Orleans

203
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,711
and came back
with a Southern accent.

204
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:03,214
(deep Southern accent):
Uh, how y'all doin'?

205
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:05,416
(crunch)

206
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,886
(dog barking in distance)

207
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,320
Chief Wiggum, how come every
time there's a terrorist chatter

208
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:13,724
in this town, you come to me?
Lay off, Apu.

209
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:15,726
When I look at people,
I don't see colors.

210
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,629
I just see crackpot religions.
Chief, is there

211
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:21,065
really a terrorist threat
to Springfield?

212
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:24,468
Yeah. I got
a very important phone call.

213
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:26,270
(phone rings)
Yello?

214
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:28,105
MAN:
Is this line secure?

215
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:30,774
Uh, it's a little jiggly
but it'll hold.

216
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,612
We got intel-- uh, that's short
for a word I don't know...

217
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:36,780
Intelligence?
I don't believe so, no.

218
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:40,885
Anyway, this intel says that
someone in town has been turned

219
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,487
and they're working for terrorists.
(gasps)

220
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:46,390
Now, I got to go check
my other suspects.

221
00:10:46,424 --> 00:10:48,225
Uh-huh.

222
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,361
But I may be back.

223
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:56,100
Huh?

224
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:59,103
(gasps)
Dad's kneeling on a prayer mat.

225
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:01,772
He doesn't believe in kneeling.

226
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:05,442
(chanting indistinctly)

227
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:08,512
Huh? It looks like he's praying.

228
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:12,116
To the east. The Middle East.

229
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,784
Mecca.

230
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:22,893
(quietly): He's targeting
the nuclear plant.

231
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:29,667
Meow?

232
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,936
If you are a cat, prove it.

233
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,939
Do you hate Mondays,
like Garfield? (screeches)

234
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:37,841
And do you love lasagna,
like me?

235
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,276
Meow.

236
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:41,345
Okay then.

237
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:42,713
(humming happily)

238
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:48,886
Mom, I have to tell you
something about Dad,

239
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,120
something big!

240
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:53,490
I know. He's changed.

241
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:54,558
Exactly.

242
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:55,793
For the better.

243
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:57,361
And men don't
change that way.

244
00:11:57,395 --> 00:11:58,068
But-but...

245
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,830
Do you know what
we're doing on Sunday?

246
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:02,366
Brunch with the Hibberts.
Then the tile store.

247
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,770
He's like a husband
in a widow's memory-- perfect.

248
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:09,406
(grunting)

249
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:11,408
Perfect.

250
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:13,677
Perfect.

251
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:21,585
(beeping)

252
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:23,921
(phone rings)
FBI.

253
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:26,156
I think someone I love
is a terrorist.

254
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:27,758
Does that make me crazy?

255
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,760
No, no. Not at all.

256
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:32,763
It took me two hours to get
home. Traffic was <i>crazy.</i>

257
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:34,598
Are you people
talking about me?

258
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:36,767
No. We're not even
here right now.

259
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,780
742 Evergreen Terrace.
I'll be right there.

260
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:51,715
And don't believe what
you've heard about me.

261
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,752
I haven't heard anything
about you except from you.

262
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:59,623
Hanging up
the receiver, eh?

263
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:01,525
(gasps)
How much did you hear?

264
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,860
How much did you say?

265
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:03,927
Nothing, really.

266
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:06,096
So I heard half of nothing.

267
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:09,133
Dad, you're scary
when you're calm and focused.

268
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,869
Lisa, I'll miss you
when this is all over.

269
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:13,237
When what's all over?

270
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:15,239
This conversation.
(chuckles nervously)

271
00:13:15,273 --> 00:13:17,441
See you on the other side.

272
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:18,776
What other side?

273
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,711
Of the house.
Where the fireplace is.

274
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,446
We're toasting marshmallows.

275
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,214
Marsh...

276
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:26,450
mallows.

277
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:39,012
I'm Bart Simpson.
Who the hell are you?

278
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:40,847
Agent Crawford, FBI.

279
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:43,082
You guys know I don't talk
to field agents.

280
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:44,918
Get your boss on the phone.

281
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:47,553
I'm not here for you.
I'm here for your dad.

282
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:49,555
What do you want
with his dad?

283
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,190
Go back to
sleep, Milhouse.

284
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:52,592
How do you know my name?

285
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:55,128
I didn't. But I do now.

286
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,298
Don't talk.
Okay.

287
00:13:58,332 --> 00:13:59,966
I want you to know
I'm the best there is

288
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,391
at finding out
what you're up to.

289
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,001
Ooh.

290
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:04,137
I can torture you.
I can give you incredible sex.

291
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:06,372
Or you can just tell me
what I want to know.

292
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:07,383
What was the
first one again?

293
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:08,408
I see.

294
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:10,209
You're stupid.
Hey.

295
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:12,211
I'm the one in bed
with two beautiful women.

296
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:13,212
(gasps)

297
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,149
You think
I'm beautiful? Oh!

298
00:14:16,183 --> 00:14:18,117
In a breaking-and-entering
kind of way.

299
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:20,119
Well, give me something,
or I'm not leaving.

300
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:21,888
(snoring)

301
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:25,325
Let's just say I've got
to get to work on time.

302
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:28,728
And if you knew me, you'd know
just how odd that sounds.

303
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:30,596
Who are you
talking to?

304
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:32,165
No one.

305
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:35,301
You're in too deep, Annie.
Get out.

306
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:37,303
Are you real, or my imagination?

307
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:39,706
Either way,
my advice is sound.

308
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:43,943
I love my job.

I don't know what horrors
you saw in Boise,

333
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:55,915
but it's not worth
blowing up everyone you love.

334
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:57,417
I'm not blowing up the plant.

335
00:15:57,451 --> 00:15:58,818

355
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,612
and it's only the end
of the first verse!

356
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:01,881
LISA:
<i>But I saw you praying to Mecca.</i>

357
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:04,784
Lisa, I've never prayed
to a city in my life,

358
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:07,720
and if I did, it would be
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

359
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:10,823
I was kneeling on the
affirmation rug they gave me.

360
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:13,593
See?

361
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:15,161
(rhythmically): Ow, this rug is hard
on my knees.

362
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:16,596
Ow, this rug is
hard on my knees.

363
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,964
Ow, this rug is hard
on my knees.

364
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:20,433
But wait, wait, wait.
What is this?

365
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:22,735
Lisa, the most horrible truth
of all is,

366
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:26,439
the plant where I work poisons
our water and our air.

367
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:28,741
I've told you that
a million times.

368
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:32,445
Aw, sweetie, you told me a
thousand things a million times.

369
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:35,181
Even with a brain
the size of a dinosaur's,

370
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:36,949
I couldn't take that in.

371
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:38,751
Anyhoo, this canister

372
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,821
is full of spoiled milk
and utility-grade chicken,

373
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:44,457
both sold to me by Apu
this morning.

374
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:45,825
When I release it

375
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,593
into the AC system,

376
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:49,929
it'll stink up
the plant forever.

377
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:53,099
No one can use it,
but no one gets hurt.

378
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:55,835
Just like
when I smell up the toilet.

379
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:56,836
(knocking)
(gasps) Huh?

380
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,838
(grunting)

381
00:17:58,872 --> 00:17:59,839
(door opens)

382
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:00,840
There he is.

383
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:02,708
Use your fattest handcuffs.

384
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:04,510
Hey. Uh, it's not
what you think, Lou.

385
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:05,645
Lou, Lou, Lou.

386
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,646
(ululating):
Lou-Lou-Lou-Lou-Lou...!

387
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,014
(groans)

388
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:10,116
I can complete my dad's mission

389
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,718
just like George W. Bush.

390
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:15,521
I can't shoot a little girl.

391
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:17,123
(gunshot)
Ah, damn it!

392
00:18:17,157 --> 00:18:18,691
There's some things
they just don't teach you

393
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:22,261
in the police academy... movies.

394
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,631
(distorted grunting)

395
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:30,703
(electronic trilling)

396
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:32,171
(rhythmic chugging)

397
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:35,508
We did it, Dad. We did it.

398
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:36,876
We sure did.

399
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,877
(grunts)

400
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:40,179
You weren't shot.

401
00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:42,915
No, I was just up late
watching a movie.

402
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,718
Something with
William Holden and...

403
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:47,053
(snoring)

404
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:53,893
Your plan failed.

405
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:55,248
Thank God this
plant has never had

406
00:18:55,262 --> 00:18:56,662
a functioning
air conditioner.

407
00:18:56,697 --> 00:18:58,364
Wait a minute, Burns.

408
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,166
You don't have a functioning
AC system at a nuclear plant?

409
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,567
That's against the law.

410
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:03,202
That's impossible.

411
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:05,004
Smithers, didn't we move
this plant to China?

412
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:06,405
Sir, that's two years from now,

413
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,907
and you're not supposed
to tell anyone.

414
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:08,975
Oopsie.

415
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:13,112
There isn't a prison made
that can hold me.

416
00:19:13,146 --> 00:19:15,281
Prisons are still made
of mud and wattles, right?

417
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:18,918
No. Concrete.
(gasps loudly)

418
00:19:18,952 --> 00:19:21,254
You know, Dad, just because
your mission's complete,

419
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:24,290
it doesn't mean you have
to go back to pork eating

420
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:26,726
and beer... drinking.

421
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,861
A beer from the sky!

422
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,264
It's a sign!

423
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,698
(laughing)

424
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,035
Yeah, this equipment will pay
for itself

425
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:37,670
in one night of binging.

426
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:44,610
I wish a mission could bring me
closer to someone, but it can't.

427
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:47,747
Okay, it's time for me
to walk alone into the sunset.

428
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:50,383
(gulps loudly)

429
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:51,984
That's better.

430
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:59,592
(groans)

431
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:16,233
Amazingly, the hamster's
older than I am.

433
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:03,903
Shh!
