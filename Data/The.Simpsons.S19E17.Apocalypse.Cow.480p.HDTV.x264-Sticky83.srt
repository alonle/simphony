and... Oh, my God!

175
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,426
A box kite! (screams)

176
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:14,364
(sighs) Well, at least
it's a beautiful night.

177
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,532
(grunts)

178
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:18,835
I'm alive!

179
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,970
All patched up!

180
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:21,037
End of story.

181
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:22,606
Actually, there's
a little more.

182
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,341
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

183
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,143
I'm sorry.
This was the only way

184
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:27,944
to lengthen Bart's
life for a year

185
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:29,346
while shortening
yours by 30.

186
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,314
I thought I was donating blood.

187
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:34,017
You are. Along with lymph,
spinal fluid,

188
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,553
and all the trimmings.
(chuckles)

189
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:39,189
But, Lisa, your brain is
still in complete control.

190
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:43,293
I could do what
I want to Bart's head?

191
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:44,594
Aw, geez.

192
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:46,229
Strangle me out
of this, Fatso.

193
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:47,597
Why you little...!

194
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:50,400
I'll teach you
to make medical history!

195
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:52,903
Oops.

196
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,072
Ah, all good.

197
00:09:56,107 --> 00:09:57,073
D'oh!

198
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:58,074
(neck cracks)

199
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:01,511
(humming)

200
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:02,946
(spits)

201
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,148
Hey, boy, since you don't need
a bedroom anymore,

202
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,418
I finally get my man cave.

203
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,220
♪ Man cave!

204
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:13,223
♪ Everyone's welcome
to my man cave! ♪

205
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:21,198
I assure you,
we've spared no effort

206
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:22,999
to accommodate your
special-needs student.

207
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:25,101
And... done.

208
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:28,071
So, in conclusion,
my show-and-tell is...

209
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:29,573
this!

210
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:32,642
Excellent, Lisa.
A-plus.

211
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:34,044
Bart, your turn.

212
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,881
Well, my show-and-tell is
that I'm on Lisa's body.

213
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:39,549
Derivative
and repetitive!

214
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:40,584
F-minus.

215
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:42,552
Aw!
(giggles)

216
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:45,622
Bart, I expected more
from a fourth-grade head.

217
00:10:45,656 --> 00:10:47,491
(gasps)

218
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:50,393
You're rotating it
in the wrong direction!

219
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:53,497
(both grunting)

220
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:56,233
That was gonna be
my show-and-tell!

221
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,668
Bart, Lisa,
I'm afraid you two

222
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:01,338
are going to be together
for a long time.

223
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:02,892
Why don't you try
to say something good

224
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,608
about each other?

225
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:06,610
Well, she's pretty
healthy for someone

226
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:07,777
who's been living
with cooties.

227
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:09,980
Bart, aren't Lisa's ears clean?

228
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:11,114
Yeah.

229
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:12,883
It's like looking down
a Canadian tunnel.

230
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:13,884
What else?

231
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:15,085
Well... now I always

232
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,120
have someone
to eat lunch with.

233
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:18,722
Great!

234
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:21,124
That's as much therapy
as your parents can afford.

235
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,262
I think we've made
some progress here.

236
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:26,263
Great...

237
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:27,464
Oh, and I have this

238
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:29,132
"two heads for one" coupon.

239
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,166
Well, that's for lettuce.

240
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,368
How about this one?

241
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:32,702
"One random disorder free

242
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:34,271
with every schizophrenia."

243
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:35,672
That's mine,
but it's expired.

244
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:37,340
D'oh!

245
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,643
(playing "When the Saints
Go Marching In")

246
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:47,017
Should've chopped off
Bart's head long ago.

247
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:51,087
Sleep well, Lis.

248
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:52,789
Somehow, sewing my head
on your shoulder

249
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:54,291
brought us
closer together.

250
00:11:54,325 --> 00:11:55,659
Rainbow...

251
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:56,826
oh, Rainbow...

252
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,329
Oh... not the pony
dream again.

253
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:03,333
(gasps)
Hey, <i>I</i> did that.

254
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:06,336
Yep, that's me.

255
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,004
When she's asleep,

256
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,406
I'm in control.

257
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,541
Lis, I'm gonna make sure

258
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:13,777
you stay asleep.

259
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:15,946
(laughs evilly)

260
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,918
Ooh, mix-ins!

261
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:24,888
Mmm.

262
00:12:24,922 --> 00:12:26,556
(snores)

263
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:27,724
(falls down stairs,
grunts, shouts)

264
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:29,225
Son of a...

265
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,493

266
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:31,528

267
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,200
(engine sputters, dies)

268
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:40,170
You start a car as well
as you start a family.

269
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:42,706
You wait here while I go
get the jumper cables.

270
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,978
MRS. SKINNER:
Oh, a panic attack, huh?

271
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:50,547
Well, I'll give you something
to panic about!

272
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:51,715
(grunting)

273
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:54,150
(groans)

274
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:57,320
Now I'll just cut off
her annoying head

275
00:12:57,355 --> 00:12:58,989
and this body will be all mine.

276
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:00,390
Or we both die.

277
00:13:00,424 --> 00:13:02,359
Not really sure
what the rules are.

278
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:03,360
(gasps)

279
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:04,728
Why, Bart?

280
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:06,496
I thought we
were friends.

281
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,732
A brother can never
be friends with his sister.

282
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:10,567
Are you really,
really sure?

283
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:11,801
I'm afraid I am.

284
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:13,937
Well, then, I guess
I have no choice.

285
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:15,405
(yells)

286
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:17,240
How could this
go wrong?

287
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:18,675
'Cause in a

Well, wherever I am,

00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:29,386
it's gotta be an improvement.

293
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,820
Guess again.

294
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:31,888

00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:48,285
Good day!

357
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:50,320
(grunts)

358
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:53,890
All of you!

359
00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:55,559
Get back out there
with your flippers flapping,

360
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:56,893
and your stumps a-stumping!

361
00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:58,128
Joe and Jane normal

362
00:15:58,162 --> 00:15:59,796
expect some entertainment
for their nickel!

363
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:01,298
Mr. Burnsum!

364
00:16:01,332 --> 00:16:04,267
You should treat these
poor people with respect!

365
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,236
Marge! Get away
from those freaks.

366
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,637
You belong to me!

367
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:09,740
The dumb, hairless brute.

368
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:13,276
Well, you are the best
this circus has to offer.

369
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,412
(laughing)

370
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:17,781
Taste the strength
of your fiancé.

371
00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:22,019
Ooh!

372
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:23,653
Ooh...

373
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:25,889
With the mighty tongue
God's given you,

374
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:29,493
why can't you speak kindly
of these imperfect angels?

375
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:32,429
Marge, they knew
what they were getting into

376
00:16:32,463 --> 00:16:34,831
when their parents sold them
to the circus.

377
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,366
Enough!
You will comport yourself

378
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:37,467
with the dignity expected

379
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:39,703
of a traveling freak show.

380
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:40,737
(grunts)

381
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:44,074
Excuse me, ma'am,

382
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:47,144
but, uh, I ain't never seen
a normal stand up for us.

383
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:48,178
(sighs)

384
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:50,213
I, too, am a freak.

385
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:51,214
One eye is blue,

386
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:53,116
and the other
a pale brown.

387
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:55,519
I wouldn't want to
be you, lady.

388
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:57,854
Never give up hope,
my friends.

389
00:17:00,324 --> 00:17:02,793
Of all the kisses
I have ever gotten in my life,

390
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:04,294
that was the first.

391
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:06,129
Hey, you should
ask her out, Moe.

392
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:08,632
Ah, but she's sweet
on the strong man.

393
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,867
You're fine unless
Rabbit Ears hears

394
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:12,436
and tells Big Mouth.

395
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,404
(whispering)

396
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,540
Wha...?!

397
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:19,376
I ain't got no chance
with the strong man's girl.

398
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,877
He makes ten dollars a week

399
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:22,479
plus all the sawdust he can eat.

400
00:17:22,513 --> 00:17:24,147
Well, you've got
an emerald ring.

401
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,850
My mother's ring.

402
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:27,851
(sobs)

403
00:17:27,885 --> 00:17:29,820
She gave it to me
on her deathbed.

404
00:17:29,854 --> 00:17:31,855
She also acquired it
on her deathbed.

405
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,723
That was a very busy deathbed.

406
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,358
With an emerald that big,

407
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:36,860
I could buy anything.

408
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:38,728
A jalopy, an icebox,

409
00:17:38,763 --> 00:17:40,897
a steamer trunk full of fedoras!

410
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:43,400
But how do I get my hands on it?

411
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:45,001
Oh, I'm an idiot!

412
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:46,002
Of course!

413
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:47,370
I get Marge to marry Moe,

414
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:48,472
then I kill Moe,

415
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:49,606
then she gets the ring,

416
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,274
then I marry her
and the ring is mine.

417
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:54,144
And the brilliance of my plan
is its simplicity.

418
00:17:55,313 --> 00:17:57,781
You're gonna be sorry
you said that.

419
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:01,118
<i>You're</i> gonna be sorry
you said that.

420
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,853
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

421
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:06,623
whoa, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh...

422
00:18:06,657 --> 00:18:08,692
I just lost my keys!

423
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:10,427
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

424
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:13,396
What do you know?
I <i>am</i> gathering moss!

425
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:14,731
(owl hoots)

426
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,134
Hey, Marge, you want
to marry Moe?

427
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:19,503
I'm engaged
to you, my love.

428
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:22,105
The poor, lonely fellow
is about to die.

429
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,507
Really? How?

430
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,408
Well, let me
worry about how.

431
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:28,245
But you know, you could make
his last day a happy one.

432
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,547
And the ring is just
the icing on the cake.

433
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:31,748
What ring?

434
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:34,584
The ring that'll get me
out of this lousy circus

435
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:36,153
and into a good circus.

436
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:37,420
Now, let's get you married.

437
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:39,523
But wouldn't you
be jealous, my love?

438
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:42,058
(laughs) Dear, I am not
the jealous type.

439
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:44,060
And from you,
I have learned

440
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,297
to feel compassion
for these disgustos.

441
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:48,765
Aw...

442
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,302
(solemnly):
♪ She's a superfreak

443
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,437
♪ Superfreak

444
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:57,440
♪ She's superfreaky

445
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:59,009
♪ Yow.

446
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:00,177
"Yow" indeed.

447
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:01,311
And so, with the conclusion

448
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:02,646
of our traditional wedding song,

449
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,181
I now declare you

450
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:05,615
husband and wife.

451
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,552
Moe, whatever small time
together we have

452
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:10,787
will be wonderful.

453
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:11,922
(laughs)

454
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:13,490
A very small time!

455
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:15,358
Those are strange
things to say,

456
00:19:15,393 --> 00:19:17,928
but a wedding is no place
to worry about threats

457
00:19:17,962 --> 00:19:19,629
from the bride's former lover.

458
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:20,964
Now, the toast.

459
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,265
To you, Marge.

460
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,867
Now you are
one of us.

461
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,635
FREAKS (chanting):
One of us!

462
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,637
Gooble goo!

463
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:29,706
One of us!

464
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,374
Gooble goo!

465
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,810
Why is it company parties
always get weird?

466
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:35,145
(cork pops)

467
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:37,547
God, you are
so beautiful

468
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:38,782
in that
peignoir there.

469
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:41,151
I, uh, better
freshen up a little bit.

470
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:44,120
(humming)

471
00:19:44,155 --> 00:19:45,555
Set it to "massage," Jumbo.

472
00:19:47,024 --> 00:19:49,659
(humming)

473
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:52,829
Hmm? What
are you doing?

474
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:55,198
Oh! Trying
to kill Moe

475
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:57,033
so we'll get
his emerald!

476
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:58,301
By the way,
I haven't checked,

477
00:19:58,336 --> 00:19:59,569
but emeralds
are valuable, right?

478
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:00,604
(gasps)

479
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:02,138
Strong Man!

480
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:04,474
Moe may be ugly
on the outside,

481
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:07,744
but inside, you are
the true monster.

482
00:20:07,778 --> 00:20:09,679
Leave my trailer forever!

483
00:20:09,714 --> 00:20:11,081
<i>You're</i> rejecting <i>me?</i>

484
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:15,418
But I'm in the best shape
anyone is in the 1930s.

485
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:16,753
I said go!

486
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:18,021

487
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:22,359

Gooble goo!

491
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:27,764
What the hell does
"gooble goo" mean?

492
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:28,965
(chanting):
We don't know!

493
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,033
Gooble goo!

494
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,234

Gooble goo!

(gasps)

497
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:36,640
You killed Burnsum!

498
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:38,908
Now who is gonna say,
"Step right up"?

Gooble goo! Gooble goo!

Tar and
feather him!

501
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:45,048
Tear off his drumsticks!

502
00:20:45,082 --> 00:20:47,183
Make him...
one of us!

This is exactly why

00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:52,689
circus attendance is plummeting!

506
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:56,593
And that, kids, is
how I met your mother.
