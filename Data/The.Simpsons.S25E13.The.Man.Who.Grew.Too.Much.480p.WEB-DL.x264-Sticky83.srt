1
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,218
Jake: Are you guys
ready for this?

2
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,253
Billy: Yes, yes.

3
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,655
Here it comes!

4
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,857
Oh! Oh! Oh! (Chuckles)

5
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,359
(Laughing)

6
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,028
Oh my God!
That's so weird.
Gunderson: Oh!

7
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,196
Oh!

8
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,099
Wow. Why don't we
hang out more often?

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,701
I told you he can
still do it. I told you.
All right.

10
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,071
Yes, you can
vomit without
finger penetration.

11
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,238
You're a freak
of nature.

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,040
Thank you.
You must be so
proud of yourself.

13
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,575
You say that like
it's no big deal.

14
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,710
Oh, you must be so...
That's not easy to do
by the way.

15
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,379
That actually burned more than
I thought it would.

16
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,513
Billy: That was amazing.
Gunderson: Yeah.

17
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,048
Billy: Ah!
Here he is.

18
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,650
All: Rocks!

19
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,286
Gunderson:
It's a time warp
Billy: Yeah!

20
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,768
Rocks: Hey, we can let go,
we don't...

21
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,190
Gunderson: How are you doing?
Jake: Oh, God.

22
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,192
Look at this we're getting
the band back together.
This is weird.

23
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:34,426
This is weird, but us.

24
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,028
Holy shit, all right!

25
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,465
Welcome to
my final day in
New York City.

26
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,301
So, if you'll just
follow me, it begins.

27
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,302
Gunderson: Here we go.
Jake: All right.

28
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:44,903
Hey!
All right.

29
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,039
Billy: Yes. Yeah.
Did you burn your legs out?

30
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,474
Whoo! Let's go
guys! Yeah!

31
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,709
Hey, what'd you think
about to make yourself
throw up?

32
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,345
Uh, the future.

33
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:30,749
Oh!

34
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,688
Are you gonna
tell him?

35
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,090
Tell me what?

36
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,791
It sucks. Maybe
I'll just bail.

37
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,393
Bail? Bail on
what, Billy?

38
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,462
Billy: You don't
think I should?

39
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,097
You don't think I should?
Guys, what the hell
are you talking about?

40
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,598
Gunderson: You don't wanna go
to work, don't go to work.

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,833
Whoa! Work?
You're kid...

42
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,002
Today? You shitting me?
I have to go.

43
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,537
Come on. No, no, no.

44
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,172
Look, like,
yesterday, my partner
cornered me at the...

45
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,974
At the firm and he said
because we have this...
Not today.

46
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,416
It's just gonna be
like, for an hour.

47
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,204
All right. Ready?
Hold on. Hold on.

48
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,047
Three, two, one, go. Go!

49
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,017
Oh! Not even close.

50
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,351
Not even close.

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,187
Oh!

52
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,222
I wasn't looking.
Did you see?

53
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,458
I'm sorry, ladies,
are you missing
a little boy?

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,860
Okay...
Is this little
boy yours?

55
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,595
Okay.
He's not yours?

56
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,730
He's just following us.
We don't know
whose he is.

57
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:19,798
I have to pee.

58
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,067
Oh, God I have to pee.

59
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,536
Could be a different city.
Correct. Yeah.

60
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,972
So, even if you're clothed
when you have an erection
exactly.

61
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,140
Yes.
That's out and greasy.

62
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:29,608
Okay.
Up to two is this?

63
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,219
Jake: All right. All right.
Time to start drinking.

64
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,625
260 blocks,
the entire length
of Manhattan,

65
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,528
my final day in
the city, so...

66
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,763
To one last
great adventure.

67
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,532
Okay, just
real quick.

68
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,334
Does it have to be last?
How about another?

69
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,768
Sure.
You got it.

70
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,170
Really?
Wait a second, you
know what, how about...

71
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,204
It's his toast.
Let him have his toast.

72
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,939
Another in the
long series of...

73
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,874
All right, fine.
In a long series
of adventure.

74
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,277
(Stammers) Maybe just...
How about one?

75
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,845
To coming
and semen.

76
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,447
You got it.
I like it.

77
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,515
I'll drink to that.
To coming and semen.
Yeah.

78
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,451
And all the joy
they provide.

79
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,920
Rocks: Yeah? Yeah.

80
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,388
Oh wow!

81
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,956
Did you hold up?

82
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,038
It's like, it's like giving
head to a fine gentleman.

83
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,526
(Chuckles)

84
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,528
Give me that.
Billy: All right.

85
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,530
Ah!

86
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,266
Careful.
Okay.

87
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,567
All right.

88
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,235
We gotta get
moving, guys,

89
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,337
this island's not
gonna walk itself.
260 blocks.

90
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,974
(Car horns blaring)

91
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,219
Jake: All right,
now is as good
a time as any.

92
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,921
A robber walks
into your house.
All: Oh.

93
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,590
That's what I'm
talking about. Robber
walks into your house,

94
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:55,160
says,<i> Sophie's choice,</i>
you gotta pick one or
I'll shoot you in the face.

95
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,297
This is just
occurring to me,
but why is he a robber?

96
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,299
Uh, you meet the
love of your life...
I mean, what's he robbing?

97
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,900
You of your time.
This woman is
perfect. She's like.

98
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,769
An 11 out of 10.

99
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,937
All right. She got this
incredible body and
the sex is great.

100
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,173
Intelligent.
Is that
intelligent sex?

101
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,342
Don't worry
about it, you're
never gonna have it.

102
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,344
I'm gonna go on.
All right, so time comes
in the relationship,

103
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,646
about six
months in...

104
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,015
Where it's time to
meet her family, okay?

105
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,017
So you all decide
to go away to
a little county house,

106
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,752
just you and her
and her folks,

107
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,020
for about
two weeks.

108
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,022
But you all share
one bathroom.

109
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,957
That's important.
All right, now

110
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,479
for the entire time
you're there, remember,
two weeks, long time.

111
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,595
Every time you have
to take a shit,

112
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,265
you do it...
(Clears throat)

113
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,470
You have to take
a shit in the bathtub.

114
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:39,705
(Chuckles)

115
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,373
All right, okay.
Boom!

116
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,676
Okay, all right, wait
I'll tell you what I'd do.
I would just hold it in.

117
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,211
You can't.
You can't hold it in.

118
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,146
Why not.
Firstly, it's impossible.

119
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,215
Secondly, it's
against the rules.

120
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,885
And thirdly after you
leave that dookie
in the bathtub,

121
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,520
you have to
deny it forever.

122
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,002
You can never say
that it was you.
Wow.

123
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,858
Billy: Is this a museum?

124
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,294
Rocks: Well, that ends the
relationship, so fine.

125
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,896
Not necessarily, I mean,
remember, this is like,
the perfect woman,

126
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,531
so she might
forgive you

127
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,900
Billy: Got it.
Shit down the drain.
Shit down the drain.

128
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:12,137
Billy: What? I'm just trying
to understand the parameters
of the scenario.

129
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,638
Rocks: What's
option number two?

130
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,307
Jake: Uh, right.

131
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,476
Option two.
Okay, so...

132
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,411
For the next year,
starting tomorrow,

133
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,747
everywhere
you go, you,

134
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,383
and only you are
responsible for taking
two cars.

135
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,884
(Chuckles)

136
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,206
So, the logistics...
(Man shushes)

137
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,821
Uh, so think
about it.

138
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,991
If you need to go
to work, then you
need to drive there,

139
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,494
then you have to
somehow get back,
walk or cab or something.

140
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,429
And then you have
to take another car,
then you're there.

141
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,897
Can you...
No, you can't walk.

142
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,499
Can...
And no you can't
take the subway.

143
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,034
Okay? You can't tow
the car. You can't get
a ride. Nothing like that.

144
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,536
Okay.
Uh...

145
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,171
What kind of gas
mileage do these get?

146
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,606
What is the
matter with you?

147
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,841
How do you clothe
and feed yourself
seriously?

148
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,476
How are you
such an asshole?

149
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,245
Practice.
Okay.

150
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,113
Yeah?
All right. I, okay
option two is

151
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,615
take two cars and...

152
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,384
Option one is
fortnight of in-law
bathtub shitting.

153
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,619
Yeah. Okay.
Not even a question.

154
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,020
I'm gonna go
option two.

155
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,088
Uh.
Take the two cars...

156
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,856
Why is that not a question?

157
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,558
'Cause I can't even
imagine what Emma's
parents would do.

158
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,093
I don't even
wanna see it.
Yeah.

159
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,128
If I was to shit
in their bathtub.

160
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,197
It's true and she
shouldn't forgive you.
Nightmare.

161
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,365
No.
Shouldn't...

162
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,300
Where is your
sense of romance?

163
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,068
I mean this is the
love of your life
we're talking about.

164
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,904
Yeah but the love
of your life should
leave you

165
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,605
if you defecate
in the bathtub.

166
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,742
You're...
Don't knock freestyle
defecation, man.

167
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,977
Okay, so that's
what you would do.

168
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,079
You're a bathtub,
bathtub kinda guy?
I'm not knocking it

169
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,614
I just wanna be
honest about it.

170
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,749
I'm just... I'm not
you don't have to
lie about it

171
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:31,983
playing this game

172
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,351
I find it childish
and silly.

173
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:34,886
(Chuckles)

174
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,688
Classic gunderson.

175
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,161
Do they have
museums in Ohio?
Oh fuck.

176
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,763
(Chuckles)
Fuck you.

177
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,097
You couldn't
help yourself.

178
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,399
No, do you...

179
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,934
This is a
dumb question.

180
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,836
Is that a serious question?
What museums are in Ohio?

181
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,871
Uh, the...
Woman: Excuse me.

182
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,073
Sorry.
We'll be quiet.

183
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,509
Yeah.
What is wrong with you?

184
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,177
Who? Which one?

185
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,580
Don't put your bare
feet on the bench
up like that.

186
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,248
Come on.
She's right.

187
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,816
Put it down.
Sorry. Sorry.

188
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,352
People actually have
to sit there after you.

189
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,354
I got it.
Put your feet down.

190
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,689
I gotta put
my socks on.

191
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,290
Woman:
It's disgusting.

192
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,493
Okay.
You've been
moving around

193
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:17,162
and sitting there like
a child for 10 minutes.

194
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,931
You're just
incredibly rude.

195
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,800
Okay, that's called
cognitive dissonance.

196
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:22,968
Yeah. Ding ding.

197
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,003
I said, excuse me.
Yeah, okay.

198
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,038
And I said that's what
we call cognitive dissonance.

199
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,007
Right, and then I put
my sock on. That's
what happened.

200
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,889
So, we've have
covered everything.
Come on, Barb.

201
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,677
Gunderson: Oh, don't
drag Barbara into this.
Billy: Yeah.

202
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm gonna request that
you boys be thrown out.

203
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,282
No.
Wait, wait,
no, no, no.

204
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,384
No don't do that.
All: No.

205
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,686
Why don't we just
step outside.

206
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,322
You me,
tweety bird there.

207
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,724
Let's take you out
for a nice juicy steak.

208
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,492
Yeah.
(Chuckles)

209
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,693
Rocks: We're young.
We're flirty.

210
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,729
We're nervous.
I'm nervous around
older women.

211
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,532
Because I assume
you're older,
I'm not sure.

212
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,867
Gunderson:
We could all just
have a little fun.

213
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,903
So let me ride the
lightning of your love.

214
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,971
I would definitely
get that little canary
to sit on my finger.

215
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,540
Come on.
(All chuckle)

216
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,641
Fuck you!

217
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,643
All: Oh!
Shhh!

218
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,711
You're in a museum.
Have some respect.

219
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,746
Excuse me?

220
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,548
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles)

221
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,049
You really should
get your feet off there.

222
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,651
Oh, dude.
For real it's disgusting.

223
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,219
How old are you?
She's got a great point.

224
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,954
Really? Okay.
Yeah.

225
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,699
(Flushing)

226
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,950
(Shaking permanent marker)

227
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,525
Billy, let me ask
you a question.

228
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,728
Do you have a single
independent thought
in that head of yours?

229
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,929
Why are we friends
with you again?

230
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,397
Yeah, why are we even
friends with you again?

231
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,099
Gunderson: Come on,
you love me.

232
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,635
I'm an anarchist,
but I'm not a dangerous one.

233
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,904
I don't accept that
there's any order
in the cosmos

234
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,106
but I do want
the trains to run.

235
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,176
I mean, I'm just looking
at the two of you and...

236
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:14,579
You do everything
he does, like,
you're just...

237
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,449
You're his shadow.
I mean why did you
order an egg cream?

238
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,117
What are you intimating?
I love egg creams.

239
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,652
Why else would I order...
Delicious.

240
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,554
Yes, they are
delicious. Yeah.
You love egg creams?

241
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,489
Then tell me,
lover of egg creams,

242
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,991
what's in an egg cream?

243
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,892
Rocks: You don't have
to answer that.

244
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,227
What?
No, he does.

245
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,895
What's, what's in
an egg cream?

246
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,430
It's fine. All right,
all right I'm gonna
tell you.

247
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:35,233
Okay. First of all
there is chocolate.

248
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,635
Cream.
Chocolate syrup.

249
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,604
Syrup and there
are eggs in there.
Seltzer. Seltzer.

250
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,573
Rocks: Seltzer. Seltzer.
Billy: And there's seltzer.

251
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,675
Whole milk...
Uh, there's...
You know...

252
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,144
You know what,
there are... who cares
what is in the egg...

253
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,812
I don't...
All that matters

254
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,180
is that they're refreshing
and delicious.
Right.

255
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,182
Couldn't agree more.
Okay?

256
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,570
(Train whistle sounds)

257
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,714
Gunderson: Look no one
wants to stop you from going
and helping your dad,

258
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,516
but why are you
staying there?

259
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,652
You don't know anything
about rubber and plastic.

260
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,121
Jake: Ach, what's there
to know. And that's not
the point anyway.

261
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,724
The point is that it's
a stable career and
that's what I need.

262
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,460
You know what else
is stable? Death.
You should try that.

263
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,529
Gee whiz, thanks, buddy.
That makes me feel
a whole lot better.

264
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,164
You're welcome.

265
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,232
Jake: What do you want
me to do? My dad needs me,
you know.

266
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,701
He asked for my help
and I'm gonna help him.

267
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,536
If I don't go now,
he's gonna have to sell.

268
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,471
Gunderson: I guess
I didn't expect you
to give up.

269
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,339
Billy, maybe...
Who said anything
about giving up?

270
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,141
My work is still up
at starving arts.

271
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,743
You know, like...

272
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,079
I can still paint from
wherever I am, including Ohio.

273
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,681
You know, tabatha
thinks it's very sweet.

274
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,716
Oh, so you're taking
advice from your
ex-girlfriend?

275
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,517
Nice.
A friend.
A current friend, as well.

276
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,352
Sure, that's a
sound decision.

277
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,555
Jesus, man there's
only so many times
I can watch my bank account

278
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,024
fall before zero before
I want to kill myself.

279
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,158
You know, I'm in
my thirties...

280
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,694
And I'm moving into
my dad's basement!

281
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,362
Temporarily, I said.
Temporarily.

282
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,598
Yeah, that's what everyone
who moves into their
dad's basement says.

283
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,734
Oh my God!
And 30 years later
they murder someone.

284
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,236
Oh, I get it now.
I get it. So obvious.

285
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,339
Oh. (Chuckles)
You're gonna miss me.

286
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,674
You know me
better than that.

287
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:23,942
You are.
You're gonna miss me.

288
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,010
Come here. Give me
a goodbye kiss. Huh?
No.

289
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,213
Don't touch me.
You think our facial hair
is gonna stick together

290
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,115
nobody, nobody
likes you.
Like velcro? Baby. Baby.

291
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,116
Gunderson:
Nobody likes you.

292
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,183
Rocks: I, uh...

293
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,287
I have to meet
the baby before we
name him officially.

294
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,690
Okay, no,
I get that but...

295
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,825
But have you
considered Billy?

296
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,294
Yeah, if he's
a humongous pussy.

297
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,963
I'll name him Billy.

298
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,000
Ah, the gallery.

299
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,770
Always look like
a coffee shop to me.
(Chuckles)

300
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,438
Hey, Cece.

301
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,108
Where's my stuff?

302
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,110
Cece: Jake.

303
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,379
Ty didn't call you?

304
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,615
Who, Ty? No. Why?
What wrong?

305
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,316
Let's sit.

306
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,951
Okay.

307
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,654
Uh... (Clears throat)

308
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:11,756
Mckenze was here.

309
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,160
What? Max mckenze?
He was so drunk.

310
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,728
Oh, he's in town
because um...

311
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,497
'Cause that showing
of his, his early work.

312
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,232
It's going on all week
down in soho.

313
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,169
They have a dj.

314
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:25,937
And snacks.

315
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,374
Yeah, I know.
He was um...
(Clears throat)

316
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,410
Totally sauced.

317
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,913
And he...

318
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,517
Well, he thought
that you were trying
to copy his style.

319
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,120
The whole New York
nostalgia thing.

320
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,522
What?
I tried to explain
it to him.

321
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,757
Hold on. Hold on.

322
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,392
He thought I was
copying him?

323
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,127
He said that?

324
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,562
He destroyed them.

325
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,131
What the fuck
are you talking about?

326
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,834
Who did? Max mckenze
destroyed my paintings?

327
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,235
Jake, I am so sorry.

328
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,337
I am like...

329
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
Wait.

330
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,464
Rocks: Feet are
already tired.
Billy: Yeah, I hear you.

331
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,148
I didn't know you
got a tattoo.

332
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,116
Gunderson:
Yes Billy, I have a tattoo.

333
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,687
Just saying for the record,
I did not know
that you did that.

334
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,388
Great story.

335
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,694
(Sighs) Fuck me...

336
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,864
Cece: I saved this
one before he could
slice it up.

337
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,100
But not, not
before he...

338
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,502
Peed on it.

339
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,105
Excuse me?
He what on it?
That's piss?

340
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,876
You're always saying
how you wanted
to collaborate with...

341
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,410
Max mackenze, so...

342
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:40,745
Now you have.

343
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,854
God, I feel so bad.

344
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,589
He put his paintings
up there specifically

345
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,258
'cause that's where
mckenze got his start.

346
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,392
Really?
Yeah.

347
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,828
We should help him.

348
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,730
Gunderson: You can 't
help a dead man,
as the saying goes.

349
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,098
Billy: That is not
a saying.

350
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,833
Maybe not in
your limited experience.

351
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,234
Guys, he doesn't want
to go back to Ohio.

352
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,076
I mean, he invited tabatha.
Why did he do that?

353
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,604
Masochism.

354
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,606
No, he's just looking
for a reason to stay.

355
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,242
I'm been shaming
the guy all day.
It hasn't made a dent.

356
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,443
The dude is leaving.

357
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,878
No, we can
get him to stay.

358
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,446
Listen, I'm gonna
somehow, I'm gonna
skip this

359
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,282
checkup with Emma.
Can you still get
out of work, Billy?

360
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,683
Yeah, but you told me
not to skip.
I know but

361
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:19,951
my heart is changed.
No worries.

362
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,286
Done and done.
Okay.

363
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,721
Ooh, and what irrational
foolhardy thing
should I do?

364
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,623
You two could stop
the constant bickering.

365
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,758
We're not
constantly bickering.

366
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,294
Yes we are.
Okay, okay.

367
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,440
You know what guys,
let's uh... let's...

368
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,975
Call it a day.
No.

369
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,977
All: No, no, no.
It's been great that
we got to hang out,

370
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,578
but you're busy,
we're all busy.

371
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,947
No, not anymore. No.
No, no, forget it.

372
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,748
It's been taken care of,
let's keep walking.

373
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,283
Got a really good idea,
I think you'll like it.
Come on, now, Jake.

374
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,484
Yeah?
Absolutely, come on.

375
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,652
Billy: Let's do this.

376
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,988
Okay.
Come on.
Adventure time.

377
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,289
Let's gonna go down
memory Lane.
You're gonna love it.

378
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,291
All right.

379
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,764
Billy: It literally looks
exactly the same.

380
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,668
Hey man, thanks again for,
you know, letting us...

381
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,303
Uh, yeah,
no problem, man.

382
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,771
You guys want
some breakfast or...

383
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:47,939
Oh, did you
just wake up?

384
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,674
Oh, man remember
those days?

385
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,676
Barely.

386
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,513
(Chuckles) What?

387
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,217
Billy: I had the bed
the other way, but still...

388
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,719
Lotta history
in this room, Alex.

389
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:02,754
Lot of history.

390
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,725
You know there was
a fire here,
like eight years ago.

391
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,826
Really?
Yeah.

392
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,828
No, there was
no fire. Stop...

393
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,064
Don't start calling
it a fire again. Okay?

394
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,366
Hey, no
bickering, right?

395
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,103
He's just really
sensitive about the fire.

396
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,006
Takes a few minutes,
but it was like,
instantaneous.

397
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,875
Yeah.
This place is so much
smaller than I...

398
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,714
So was there,
like a fire or not?

399
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,250
I try to help.
That's what I do.
I'm a hero.

400
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,386
You know if somebody
else like Jake
had been there,

401
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,055
who know? The whole
place would have
probably burned down.

402
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,756
Okay, there was no fire.

403
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,559
Okay? You destroyed
everything I owned.

404
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,161
Sorry, man.
Billy: With a fire
extinguisher.

405
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,595
Brings up a lot
of old issues.

406
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,032
I almost 100%
sure there was a fire.

407
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,535
If there was a fire,
why wasn't anything
in my room burned at all?

408
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,103
Because I put the fire out.

409
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,539
I prevented your room
from burning.
You're welcome!

410
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,942
Not a single part
of the room, gunderson
was in the least bit charred.

411
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,277
Okay? And yet,

412
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,112
all my photographs
and my books

413
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,514
and my, my computer, my...

414
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,617
Magazine collection,
my mom's prized collection

415
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,220
of presidential campaign
buttons dating back to
grover Garfield

416
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,622
were completely covered
in foam and destroyed.

417
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:14,225
(Stammers)
It's just a little difficult
to reconcile with this fire

418
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,561
that you so heroically
put out.

419
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,129
I think the important
question is,

420
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,864
who the hell
is grover Garfield?

421
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,899
Okay, I misspoke.

422
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,601
That's not
a president.

423
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,570
It's not
the...

424
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,039
Point.

425
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,145
Hi.

426
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,147
No way.

427
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,352
Oh, yeah. That was here
when we got here.
Huh.

428
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,555
Man: Thought it was
pretty fucking gershwin.

429
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,290
Jake: Yeah,
it's pretty gershwin.

430
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,493
Jake: That's a good
thing, right?

431
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,162
Man: Yeah, I guess.

432
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,251
You know, I feel
like doing something
really dumb.

433
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:56,767
What do you think?

434
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,338
Oh, I don't know you.

435
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,140
Uh, guys.

436
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,648
Billy: No, no,
I know Mr. Kim.

437
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,585
Larry, sorry.
Yeah, yeah it's just that,
it's just flared up.

438
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:17,027
It's terrible timing
and I really wanted to come
to work today.

439
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,258
Billy: It's just a general
kind of hurting feeling.

440
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,160
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

441
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,395
Uh, no, no, no.

442
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,830
It's a urologist...

443
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,166
(Inaudible)

444
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,004
How much for all those?
Five?

445
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,839
How much for everything?

446
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,410
Squirrel and
a hydro post.

447
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,313
It's got a little nut for
a football.

448
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,648
What, rocks
thought it was funny.

449
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,749
(Both chuckle)

450
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,463
Bee in your face.
There's a bee in your face.

451
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,831
Billy: I already have
an appointment.

452
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,700
You don't have
to do that.
It's in the network...

453
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,036
Don't wanna bother
your friend on a Saturday.

454
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,724
Rocks: There he is.

455
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,060
Jake: Hey.
What do you think?
Hey.

456
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,630
I like it.
Jake: Yeah?

457
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,366
You gonna leave it here?
Yeah.

458
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,468
This is kind of
a symbolic bathroom for me.

459
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,905
(Clears throat)
Truth be told tabatha
and I actually...

460
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,907
Had sex in there.

461
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,675
Go on.

462
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,611
It was super uncomfortable.

463
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,046
But, you know I've
actually thought about it a
lot about it since then and...

464
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,670
Even though it was awful,
honestly awful.
Disgusting...

465
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,186
(Flushing)

466
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:58,256
I think it was maybe
one of the most

467
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,424
enjoyable sexual
encounters of my life.

468
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:01,959
In retrospect.

469
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,862
It's so hard to pee
with a boner.

470
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,330
(Chuckles)
I'm sorry about that.

471
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,568
God to say it out loud,
it sounds so uh, trite.

472
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,103
Sex in the bathroom?
Jake: Yeah.

473
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,041
No, no it sounds
all right.

474
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,343
I uh... I need
to tell you something.

475
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,546
When I saw
tabatha...

476
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,248
She...
At Ted and Audrey's?

477
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,450
Yeah, she told me
that her and...

478
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,120
You know,
what's-his-fuck broke up.

479
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,222
Sebastian?
Yeah.

480
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,197
What are you
talking about?

481
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,692
Are you fucking
with me?

482
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,595
Tabatha's single now?
Currently single?

483
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,997
Yeah.
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on.

484
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,632
And you found out
this when?

485
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,601
On Wednesday?
And now it's Saturday.

486
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:46,470
I thought she
was coming
to the walk,

487
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,939
she said you invited her
so I just figured you...

488
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,242
I wanted...
Are you fucking...
You know what?

489
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,078
No, I glad I
didn't know that.
Wednesday was...

490
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,246
That was bad for me.

491
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:56,814
No, it is actually
good timing.

492
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,516
This is fucking
terrible timing.

493
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,618
Dude, I'm leaving
tomorrow.

494
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,320
I do not need
to know this now.

495
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,655
Oh, come on, man
this is fucked up.

496
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,956
I mean what am I going
to do with this information?

497
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,825
In fact why didn't
she tell me?

498
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,360
Fuck her!

499
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,442
I didn't mean that.
That was knee-jerk.
That's not me.

500
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,531
She's probably
in pain. Oh God.

501
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,701
I should call here.
No, no, no, no, no.

502
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,303
What? I don't understand
what you wanted me to do.

503
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,672
God! Man, you know what
dick move for telling me.

504
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,375
Real dick move.
But I appreciate it.

505
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,477
That took guts.
Should I not have
told you at all?

506
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,812
You should not
have told me at all.

507
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,146
No.
Okay and I apologize.

508
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,348
You should have
told me before.

509
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,736
Okay, then I'm not sorry
and you're welcome.

510
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,385
I can't do
the walk, it's...

511
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,620
No in fact...
You can do the walk,
come on.

512
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,956
Ah! God!
This changes nothing.

513
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,193
This changes nothing.
You're right.

514
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,862
Right, let's go, tabatha...
Rocks... oh, fuck!

515
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,399
Jake: No and to think that...

516
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:51,068
For the last three years
she was with Sebastian.

517
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,636
Tristan before that.

518
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,038
Where are the normal
names here?

519
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,340
She's almost literally
been with somebody

520
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,309
every single day
since we broke up
and now that

521
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,745
I have a chance
to be with her, I can't

522
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,180
because I'm leaving
and I'm never going
to see her again.

523
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,083
Okay, well, why
don't we focus
on the walk?

524
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,418
I mean, where
are we going next?

525
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,819
No, I think
Jake's right.

526
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,355
Let's focus on
things that we have
no control over.

527
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,657
Gunderson, will you
look at, look at him.

528
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,493
Okay? Look at this
little face.

529
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:19,263
Cant' we, can't you be
supportive of this face
for once in your life?

530
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,698
I've been supportive.

531
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,234
Hey, who put the fire
out in your room?

532
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:26,036
Okay, for the last time
stop calling it a fire.

533
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,739
Then what should
I call it? A conflagration?

534
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,441
A holocaust?
Here we go.

535
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,209
Just drop it.
How dare you!

536
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,844
Let it go.
We lost... no.

537
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,013
I will not...
I will not...

538
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:39,617
We lost great aunts and...
You didn't lose
anyone at all.

539
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,552
Well, not directly but...
Rocks: I don't know
what that means.

540
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,421
Indirectly,
almost surely...
Okay, all right.

541
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,488
Fair. Fair.

542
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,692
Jake, I got a call
from work,

543
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:51,028
and one of my teachers
got food poisoning

544
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,596
for like,
the umpteenth time,

545
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,632
and I have to go in
for just an hour,

546
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,434
I couldn't get anyone
to cover, it's on the way.

547
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,568
It'll just be an hour.
You guys can come.
No.

548
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,103
Are you fuckin'
kidding me?

549
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:02,039
It's on the way.
No! Dude, not now!

550
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,543
Now's the worst possible
time. I've got an
existential crisis afoot.

551
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,077
You don't mean
existential.

552
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,346
I don't even know
if I mean afoot.
What does afoot mean?

553
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,387
Rocks: Pythagorean's theorem,
you guys.

554
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,222
It's super cool.
You're gonna have...

555
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,090
Five to seven
questions on it.

556
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,959
On the test,
depending on which
one you get.

557
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,195
So, I wanna go over it
and make sure we all...

558
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,063
Billy: Did you
just look at my test?

559
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,666
Gunderson, stop
looking at my test.

560
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,061
Gunderson: I'm not
looking at your test.

561
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,472
I've already done
number 21.

562
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,875
I bet you forgot
about the three quadratics,
gunderson.

563
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,880
Gunderson: I bet you forgot
that you're a college graduate
and this is pointless.

564
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,015
Billy: It won't be
pointless when I beat you.

565
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,217
Gunderson: Yes, it will.

566
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,453
Hey, is he almost
done with his class?

567
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:50,455
(Phone ringing)

568
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,793
Is that Emma?

569
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,367
I'm just disappointed.

570
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,369
I know.

571
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,905
Emma: I just...

572
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:10,508
I can't believe you
would miss one of
the last appointments

573
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,842
before the baby
would come.

574
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:14,712
I'm very sorry.

575
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,348
And to go out drinking
with your friends...

576
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,185
It's just such
a fucking cliche and...
Okay.

577
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,121
Oh my God! I sound
like I'm one of those
bitchy annoying girls.

578
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,159
Well, you have every
right to me mad, okay.
You do. I'm sorry.

579
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,695
I absolutely
shouldn't have missed
the appointment.

580
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,564
No, you should not
have missed
the appointment.

581
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:36,500
But it was not about
just drinking with
my friends, okay, it wasn't.

582
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,302
We are trying to get
Jake to stay.

583
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,371
You know if he has
a good time today,

584
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,333
he might actually do that,
it could go either way.

585
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,174
Really?
Yes.

586
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,143
And you know between
Billy and gunderson,

587
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,678
he's our only viable
babysitting option.

588
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,946
(Chuckles)

589
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,384
Oh.

590
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,653
Okay. I can't
argue with that.

591
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,590
So listen...

592
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,593
At the appointment
today...

593
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,164
Doctor leponis and I discussed
the birth plan...

594
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,799
Yeah.
You know,
and who's gonna

595
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,002
be in there when
it all goes down and...

596
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,405
I decided that I want
to keep the participants
to a minimum.

597
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,839
Fine. Yeah.

598
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,275
Okay, it'll be
just... just us.

599
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,244
Cozy.

600
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,314
No, I...
I mean not you.

601
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,950
She said that it's actually
really common

602
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,918
for women to not want
their partners in there...

603
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,753
Are you kidding?
For that. I mean...

604
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,188
God! I don't want
you to see that.

605
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,757
You just decided this?

606
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,260
Well, marcel, I...

607
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,929
You know that I've been
really stressed out
about this. I'm scared.

608
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,031
I mean, what if you
don't want me after that?

609
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,399
Are you kidding me
right now?

610
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:45,169
You're not one who
has to have a baby
coming out...

611
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,271
Of your vagina, okay?

612
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,906
Yes, I do realize that.

613
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,574
I understand how
children are born.

614
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:53,077
Look, how would
you feel, if I brought

615
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,946
a bunch of strangers
into the bathroom to watch you

616
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,315
do whatever it is you do
in there for 45 minutes.

617
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,984
That's not something
that you want people to see.

618
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,652
What are you
talking about?

619
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:04,588
How is me being there
for the birth of our son
remotely like

620
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,324
you bringing in strangers
to watch me take a dump?

621
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,159
Okay, I get that
that's not a great analogy,
now, okay.

622
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,594
No, it's not a great
analogy at all.

623
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,996
It's not even a
mediocre analogy.

624
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,897
I don't, I don't even
understand. Am I...

625
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,165
Am I the one going
into the bathroom?

626
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,400
Am I bringing
in the strangers?

627
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,402
No, you're the stranger.

628
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,003
(Sighs)

629
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,314
I didn't mean
it like that.

630
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,310
Yeah, you did.

631
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,547
Oh shit!

632
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,253
(Students chatter)
Billy: Okay, I don't know who
any of you are...

633
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,821
Billy: Inside voices, please.

634
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,090
Is there a Renee here?

635
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,393
Tasha? Is that right?

636
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,921
All right. Kuyken...
Kuykendall? Is that you?

637
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,997
Wait, what's
your question?

638
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,766
I don't know
what a function is.

639
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,000
What is a function?

640
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,135
How come you
don't know the answer?

641
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,337
Well, I...
Guys, can you?

642
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,606
Look, none of this
matters in the real world.

643
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:57,207
And I don't even
teach here.

644
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,343
Is that lady
Mr. reznowski's wife?

645
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,311
No, that is his fiancee,
but they love...

646
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,013
So his kid's gonna
be a bastard?

647
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,415
(Chuckles) Yes.

648
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,116
What are they
arguing about?

649
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,985
Jake: Ah, good question.

650
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:10,621
You know, actually French
playwright Jean anouilh
put it best.

651
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:13,157
Okay, my friend
is having an
existential crisis, please.

652
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,159
He does not
mean existential.

653
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,660
You know what,
you need to know this.

654
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,896
You really do.
So write his down
if you have to.

655
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:20,864
Life is not gonna
turn out the way
you planned it.

656
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,866
That's the bottom line.

657
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,802
Okay. And here's
another piece of advice.

658
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:27,371
Don't invest in anyone.

659
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,740
You probably
meet a guy,

660
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,442
and he's gonna
be great.

661
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,510
And you'll love him
and you give
everything to him

662
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,145
and just when
you think it's perfect...

663
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,847
He's gonna take
your heart,

664
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,049
he's gonna put it
in a blender and
he's gonna press frappe.

665
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,350
Okay. Then he's gonna
pour it down the toilet

666
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,986
and if that
wasn't bad enough,

667
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,189
you're gonna jump on
into that toilet after
and try and grab it

668
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,759
and you're gonna come out
the other side covered
in piss and shit

669
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,861
like Tim Robbins at the end
of<i> Shawshank redemption</i>

670
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:53,163
and if you haven't
seen that movie,

671
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,099
then I cannot help you.

672
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:56,934
Okay? But here's
the good news.

673
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,209
Okay, because
at the end of all that,

674
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,538
the next thing you got
marked on your calendar

675
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,742
is a probably painful,
inevitable death.

676
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,946
Gunderson:
So, all right,
class dismissed.

677
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,748
Right, why don't
you figure this out...

678
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,919
Hey, em.
Bye, guys.

679
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,556
(Sighs)

680
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,575
Decisions. That's the
big thing right now.

681
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,778
We're just having all
these arguments about...

682
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,479
You know what color
the baby's room should be.

683
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,748
Yellow or cream,
things like that.

684
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,416
Yellow.
Rocks: And I find myself

685
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,819
talking all these hard lined
positions really just to
argue, I mean...

686
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:51,255
I don't care what color
the actual baby's room is,

687
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:52,657
'cause in the end
it doesn't matter.

688
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,124
Billy: It should be yellow.
But I hear myself arguing

689
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,260
that one color
will literally lead

690
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:58,629
the child becoming
president and the other one's
gonna make him a murderer.

691
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,930
Same thing.

692
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,299
Yeah, it's totally
irrational, all right,
I mean...

693
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,501
Nobody actually
remembers what color
their baby room was.

694
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,136
Yellow.

695
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,237
Really?

696
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,338
Yeah.

697
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,439
Explains a lot.

698
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,474
It was awesome.

699
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,581
Billy: What are we
doing here? Is this
a planned stop?

700
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,216
I hate cathedrals!

701
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:21,985
Billy: Ugh!

702
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,308
And the answer is,
back in 1895,

703
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,809
"construction
of the cathedral

704
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:49,346
"was halted due
to a labor dispute

705
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,082
"that resulted in..."

706
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,685
(Clicks tongue) Fuck it.

707
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:55,953
No. (Chuckles)

708
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,955
Put myself to
sleep with that.
I apologize...

709
00:30:57,957 --> 00:30:59,157
What happened
to labor dispute?

710
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:01,658
Oh, who cares. Fuck it.
You know. (Sighs)

711
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,561
You know what,
teaching here
is one of the...

712
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:07,397
One of the great
achievements of mine
in New York.

713
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,832
Maybe the only
great achievement.

714
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,367
That's not true.
That's not true,
come on.

715
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,735
It's true! No,
honestly. I think
I did about the only thing.

716
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:12,803
No, that's
not true.

717
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:15,873
Gunderson: None
of your students have
amounted to anything. So...

718
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,975
Yeah.
Doesn't really count
as an achievement.

719
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,243
Billy: Gunderson,
come on...

720
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:20,644
Rocks: Yeah, you know,
like, great achievements.

721
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:22,145
No.
Rocks: I mean, that's it.

722
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,814
No, but...
What about that show
you had in New Jersey?

723
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:25,482
Yeah...
That was awesome.

724
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,017
It was in New Jersey
but still...
You had one in staten...

725
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,552
You had a thing
in staten island.

726
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,753
I mean, if
it's staten island,
yeah.

727
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,655
It's something.
It's something.

728
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,824
Gunderson: Remember,
you almost sold
a painting on the subway?

729
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:35,325
Billy: Oh, yeah!
No, no, no.

730
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,895
The guy almost
stole the painting
on the subway.

731
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,429
Billy: Oh.
Gunderson: But still,
he liked it.

732
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:40,998
Yeah, I guess.

733
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,165
I mean,
people who are
really excited...

734
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,600
You gotta start
somewhere.

735
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:44,842
That's true,
I guess.
It's tough.

736
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:46,904
I don't know.
It's good.

737
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,839
This is actually...
Kind of makes me feel good.

738
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,274
I love this place.

739
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,776
Really, 'cause
these are garbage.

740
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:55,612
And your fridge
is gonna be
filled with that.

741
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,714
Rocks: Yeah, I hope.

742
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,883
How do you pretend
to like that?
That's awful.

743
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,218
I don't have
to pretend.
That's a beauty.

744
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,020
I mean, I...
I genuinely
like this.

745
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:05,622
You're not understanding what
this kid did with space,
negative space.

746
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,557
Uh...
Gunderson: Now, I understand
why you like Jake's stuff.

747
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,926
Hey...

748
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,928
Is it about the money?

749
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,063
Does your dad need...
I mean...

750
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,364
Is that why
you're leaving?

751
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,199
If it is,
I'm more than happy...

752
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,301
I don't want
your money.

753
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:18,368
I'm just saying,
I'll give you a little...

754
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,304
I'm not your
charity case, okay?

755
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,105
Jacob.

756
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,446
I was wondering
if you could clear up
something for me.

757
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,149
Weren't you planning
on breaking up
with Emma

758
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,651
before you found out
she was carrying
your demon seed?

759
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,219
I... (Stutters)

760
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,622
No, man, I...
Really,
you weren't?

761
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:42,092
No, we were gonna have
a bit of a conversation

762
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:45,162
that, you know,
could've pre-empted...
Good.

763
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,464
But...
And my son.

764
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,267
Right, yeah.
But the fact...
But, I...

765
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,668
I don't... we were
definitely not gonna
break up, no.

766
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,971
Not... not for sure.
Hmm.

767
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,946
What's the latest?

768
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:05,449
Well, my partner
at the firm

769
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,117
has actually set up
an appointment

770
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,952
with his
urologist friend
for me today.

771
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,087
Right.

772
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,055
So I am telling him

773
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,324
that the rash
has spread to my legs

774
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,959
and I'm having
trouble walking.
Ah. Oh.

775
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,628
Ergo, I won't be
able to go
to his doctor.

776
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,997
Yeah. (Sighs)
Well...

777
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:20,999
Sounds medically dubious.

778
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,165
Yeah.

779
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,706
(Sighs)

780
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,344
Hey, do you think
that the guys
hate me?

781
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,380
Yeah.

782
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,249
No, seriously.

783
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,220
I mean, the whole
lawyer thing,
the money,

784
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,455
it just
feels different

785
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,125
than when we were all
unemployed and broke.

786
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,726
Yeah, you don't wanna
go back to that, though.

787
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:50,994
Well, I mean, do I?

788
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,063
Remember how much
you used to give blood?

789
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,731
Yeah...
It's not safe.

790
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,034
Yeah, but it was...
It was sort
of exciting.

791
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,468
I guess.

792
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,073
I keep thinking about

793
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:06,309
what the most
important thing is
for my son, what I...

794
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,078
What I want
for him the most,

795
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,647
besides, obviously
wanting him to be...

796
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,983
Healthy, easy-going...
Yeah, sure.

797
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,752
I think it's just
for him to be confident

798
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:16,820
and not worrying
all the time,

799
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:19,056
about what
everyone else thinks.

800
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,060
Yeah.

801
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,297
Yeah, okay.
I like that.

802
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,071
I'm sorry
for your loss.

803
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,119
(Sighs) My God...

804
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,857
The thing is, that I can't
really talk to my friends
about it, you know.

805
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,859
They're good guys, but...

806
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,396
(Sighs) It's...
We're not really
the kind of guys

807
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,698
who can, you know,
open up and...

808
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,301
(Clears throat)
And really, I'm sorry,

809
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,902
is there meant
to be, like, a booth

810
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,438
or a partition,
or wall, or...

811
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,007
That's confession
in a catholic
church, Jacob.

812
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,276
We are episcopalian.

813
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,479
Sure. Okay.
(Clears throat)

814
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,283
Just kind of feels
weird talking
to someone I can't see.

815
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,845
I feel that way
every time I talk
to God.

816
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,620
(Laughs) Zing.

817
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,322
Not really.

818
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:26,890
No. I guess not.

819
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,627
Well, I may as well
just dive into it, then.

820
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,497
I think I'm still in love
with tabatha. (Laughs)

821
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:35,132
There it is.
I am.

822
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,467
And I also know
that my dad needs me.

823
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,568
That's important.

824
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,537
Especially now.
He's sick.

825
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:45,976
But I just... I can't
shake this feeling

826
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,712
that maybe leaving
is the wrong thing
to do.

827
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,581
Let me tell you this.

828
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,584
God very rarely
limits us to two options.

829
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:58,155
In fact, our choices
are endless, infinite.

830
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,358
But it is up to us
to make one.

831
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,693
I would love to be able
to tell you what to do.

832
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,962
But I'm an episcopalian,
not a catholic priest.

833
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:06,964
Right.

834
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,267
I get it. (Laughs) Okay.

835
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,870
You know what,
just before I...
I'm not 100% on it.

836
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,907
So, when you
say "infinite"
you know, there...

837
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,775
How many
is that exactly?

838
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,377
It's like with Jesus.

839
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,578
Okay, hold on. (Laughs)

840
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,266
Accepting we
all know how that
turned out for him.

841
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,849
You know.

842
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:30,220
It's probably not
the best example,
that's all.

843
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,022
Go on.

844
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,558
I tell you what,
maybe it's time

845
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,894
that you convert
some of that
analytical energy

846
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,363
into kinetic energy.

847
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,367
Right.

848
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,853
Rocks: (Sighs)
Why is he
taking us east?

849
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,222
(Children shouting
indistinctly)

850
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,423
Gunderson: Maybe
he's gonna go
to the bathroom.

851
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:07,591
I need a cupcake.

852
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:09,226
I'm out of breath.

853
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,562
What the fuck is this?

854
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,732
Rocks: It's a birthday
party for children.

855
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,068
Goddamn it!

856
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,650
Hey. (Laughs)

857
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,287
Jake! (Laughs)
Yeah! Hey.

858
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,390
Hey. Hey, raja, ankur.

859
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:42,092
Marty.
Wait. Did you finish
your walk?

860
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,027
No, not yet.

861
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,729
We will.
I just wanted to...

862
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,230
Have you got
a second?

863
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:49,699
Could I talk to you
for a second?

864
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:50,967
Uh, yeah.
Okay. (Laughs)

865
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,802
Of course.
Come on.

866
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,604
No, I'm
not cheating!

867
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:57,874
Billy: I'm serious.

868
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,143
I cannot fucking
believe this.

869
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:02,379
I haven't been...
No, I abandoned
work for this

870
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:05,148
and now, Jake just
diverts the whole thing
for his ex-girlfriend?

871
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,883
It's unconscionable!

872
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,486
I wanna fly! I wanna fly!
I wanna fly!

873
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:10,887
Oh! Hey, there.

874
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,055
Sorry, little fella,

875
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:13,890
but we're all
out of pixie dust.

876
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,959
Oh. Oh my...
Oh, my God!

877
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,628
He just licked me!
Yeah! Get him!
Get him!

878
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,163
Why did you lick me,
you little monster?

879
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,265
Hey! I gotcha!

880
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,034
Hands! Stop it!
Stop it!

881
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,270
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky,
go, go over there.

882
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:28,405
Over there.

883
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,307
Ugh!
That kid is awful!
Oh.

884
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:31,941
Kid is my son.

885
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:34,644
Oh! Hey, friend.

886
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,979
Guys.

887
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,447
Rocks: Hey, Zeke,
how you doing?
(Laughs)

888
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,115
Whoa! Blast from
the past...

889
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,684
What are you guys
doing here?

890
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,018
Jake came
to visit tabatha.

891
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,288
We're on a bit of a...
Nostalgia tour.

892
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,956
Seriously?
Yeah.

893
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:50,026
I thought nostalgia
was supposed to be
a pleasant thing.

894
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,162
(Children screaming
and laughing)

895
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,599
Right. So...
Yeah.

896
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,769
So you have to shit
in a bathtub?

897
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,505
Yeah, two weeks,
and you can't
tell anyone.

898
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,108
You have to
deny it forever.
Yeah...

899
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,343
You know,
I forgive that.

900
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:07,711
Really?

901
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:10,246
Yeah! For the love
of my life, yeah. Yeah.
Wow!

902
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,015
Wow.

903
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,184
Yeah. But that does not
give you permission

904
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:17,153
to shit in Chuck
and Joyce's bathtub.
Do not do it.

905
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,788
Oh, bummer.
Yeah. (Sighs)

906
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,890
And as far as
the second part...

907
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,059
Hey, should I stay
in New York?

908
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,961
Do you think?

909
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:27,864
Am I doing
the right thing by...

910
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,701
I gotta get back
to the party.

911
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,204
Hmm.

912
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:42,806
You still got it.

913
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,141
Yeah.

914
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,618
(Baby wailing)
(Man shushing)

915
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,224
Man: Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

916
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,694
(Baby's crying continues)

917
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,298
Man: You got a problem?

918
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,400
You got an issue?

919
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:11,601
Do you have
a problem?

920
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,670
All right, I'm gonna
give it a shot.

921
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:16,439
Oh. Yeah, sure.
She doesn't
like men, so...

922
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:18,908
Oh. Let's see
how this works.
(Stops wailing)

923
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,477
There you go. Yeah.

924
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:21,611
(Clears throat)

925
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:23,079
There you go.

926
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:24,681
Kids like me.
Yeah.

927
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:25,815
I don't really
like them.

928
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,750
But what are you
gonna do?

929
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,486
Don't ruin
her life.

930
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:30,753
Ah.
Yeah.

931
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,327
(Wailing)

932
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,561
Thanks.

933
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,765
Okay.
Argh! Go!

934
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,003
Whoo! (Screams)

935
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,342
(Screams)

936
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,177
(Laughing)

937
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,783
Terrible choice.
Gun!

938
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,785
(Shrieks) It's Melanie!

939
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,521
(Laughs) Melanie ortmeyer?

940
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:07,190
Well, Melanie MacDonald now.
I thought that was you.

941
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,226
You're that girl
that doesn't
listen, right?

942
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:12,729
I can't believe it!
So what are
you doing here?

943
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:13,863
Living a
personal nightmare.

944
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,998
This is such a coincidence.

945
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,400
You know, I just
had a dream about you.

946
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,335
Who cares!

947
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:22,539
God! You know,
I haven't seen you
since teach for America.

948
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,708
Yeah.
I was a fucking
disaster, right?

949
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,709
You don't really wanna
have this conversation.

950
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:27,911
Oh!
Do you?

951
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:29,178
You're here with Jake.

952
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,747
I saw him, too.

953
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,349
It's just like
old times, huh?
Not at all.

954
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:34,884
I've got my little
rugrat running around
here somewhere.

955
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,086
I don't give a shit.
You have stupid glasses.

956
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,888
You never
would've have thought
I'd be a mom, right?

957
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,090
I thought you'd
be dead by now.

958
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,391
I feel so old

959
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:42,525
just saying it
to you...
Yeah, same to you later.

960
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,394
(Gasps) Oh. Bye!

961
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,229
(Screams)

962
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:50,633
Ahh! Why is this
happening to me?

963
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,137
Help!

964
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,006
(Screams) You fucking
bit me

965
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:59,042
(laughs) Yeah.
Yeah. Get him.

966
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:01,411
Oh, my God!
It's a nightmare!

967
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,013
(Laughing) Yes...

968
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,955
Billy: Oh, God!
Get off. Get off of me!

969
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:13,189
Um...

970
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,725
Do you have
another second just to...

971
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:16,793
It'll be quick.

972
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:18,962
Oh. I can't.

973
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:20,530
Well, we can. We did.

974
00:43:20,532 --> 00:43:22,098
So we've already

975
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,100
kind of, you know, done.
It's been did. So...

976
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,535
I... I can't...

977
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:27,270
I'm still
in love with you.

978
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,607
So...

979
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:34,911
Yeah.

980
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:37,480
I'll you get
back to the pixie
dust station.

981
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:38,881
Okay.
Don't say it
unless you mean it.

982
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:41,451
Okay, then, I'm still
in love with you.

983
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,819
Tabatha...

984
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,223
(Chuckles) Look.

985
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:53,429
My parents are having
one of their pre-show
dinner parties

986
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:55,732
in, like,
in an hour and a half?

987
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,967
Why don't
you come by?
We'll talk.

988
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,902
Yeah. Done.
(Laughs) All right.

989
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:02,071
Look, I... I'm just
warning you.

990
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,644
I've been crying
for, like, three days,
on and off.

991
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,146
Mostly, on.

992
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:14,183
So I don't know
if this is nostalgia or...
I just...

993
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,818
Come at your own peril,
that's what I'm saying.

994
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,540
Understood.
(Whispers) Okay,
no more talking.

995
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,089
We'll talk about it
on the way over.

996
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:21,824
(Muffled) Okay.

997
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,393
(Chuckles)
Great.

998
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:27,196
Oh. Can I
meet you there?

999
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,032
Mmm-hmm.
Okay.

1000
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,701
Okay.

1001
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,804
Fuck...

1002
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:37,540
How quickly...
What is the vaginal
rejuvenation like?

1003
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:40,209
(Laughs) Good question.

1004
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:42,278
That I don't
actually know.

1005
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,347
Because Noreen
had a c-section.

1006
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,683
Oh, okay.
Right, so it was fine.

1007
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:50,286
Or it would've been fine
if we have had any desire

1008
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:51,621
to have sex afterwards.

1009
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,556
(Groans)

1010
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,225
Do you remember
boys' breakfast
every Saturday?

1011
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:57,560
Yeah.
God.

1012
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,363
The only way
that a girl
would get invited

1013
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,899
was if she'd slept
with one of us
the night before.

1014
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:03,901
Bunch of assholes!

1015
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:05,234
(Laughs)

1016
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,204
Anyway,
boys' breakfast turns
into couples' brunch,

1017
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,107
which eventually
becomes birthday parties.

1018
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,911
Completely elaborate,
unnecessarily complicated
birthday parties

1019
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,447
at which I am dressed
as a pirate.

1020
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,248
(Inhales)

1021
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,918
And somebody's gotta
take you to breakfast.

1022
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,221
I haven't
had pancakes
in eight years.

1023
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,723
I'll make you pancakes.

1024
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,091
Shit!

1025
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,095
What? I'm
doing it now.
Now.

1026
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:33,262
You're doing it now?
Dad!

1027
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,397
Yes, I...
I'm getting
the dessert.

1028
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,498
What do you mean,
what have
I been doing?

1029
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,566
I'm... I've
been playing
with children!

1030
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:38,234
(Ricky screaming)

1031
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,370
Now!
Ricky, not now.

1032
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:43,506
Ricky,
that's enough.
Now!

1033
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:46,142
Woman: Before the party

1034
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,077
that I organized...
Dad!

1035
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,112
I planned this!

1036
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,921
Oh. Okay.

1037
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,923
Guys, I need
to tell you something.
(Cell phone rings)

1038
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,425
Billy: Oh,
look who it is!

1039
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,060
Jake, it's my partner.

1040
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:06,129
You know the guy
I've been lying to all day

1041
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:07,864
so that we could
go out and have
an adventure,

1042
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:09,232
that guy,
remember that?

1043
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:10,900
Yeah, I do.
Unconscionable.

1044
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:13,136
Yeah, I know,
I got the files.

1045
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:14,270
You know what,
I'm actually

1046
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,938
on my way
to the doctor's
right now.

1047
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,641
He's gotta go.
Fuck you!
Oh.

1048
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:20,877
Gunderson,
what the fuck!

1049
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:22,912
What the fuck!
(Mocks) "What the fuck!"

1050
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:25,248
This... no,
this is not a joke,
okay? This is my job.

1051
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,983
Oh, it's not
a joke?
No.

1052
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:28,184
Is this a fucking joke,
"this is a tattoo?"
All right, guys.

1053
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,286
You know what,
I told you before that

1054
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,587
I didn't know
that you got a tattoo.
Jake: Okay.

1055
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:32,989
Gunderson: Oh, you didn't
know I got a tattoo.
Guys.

1056
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:34,590
Billy: That is correct.
For one second,
if I could just...

1057
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,758
And anyway mine
is completely different.

1058
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,859
Rocks.

1059
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,796
What? Just leave
me out. What...
Rocks!

1060
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:41,497
Yeah, fine.
He knew.

1061
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,800
Rocks!

1062
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:45,935
When he found out
about your "this is not
a tattoo" tattoo,

1063
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,436
he decided
it'd be ironic

1064
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:49,071
if he got a "this is
a tattoo" tattoo.

1065
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:50,406
It doesn't matter.
Who cares?

1066
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:52,041
That's not ironic,
you imbecile.

1067
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,277
Yeah, it is!
No, it's not!

1068
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:56,846
You have a tattoo
that says it's a tattoo.

1069
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,949
That's the exact
opposite of what
"ironic" means!

1070
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,285
Yeah, but that
is the ironic part.

1071
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:04,087
No, it's not.
Yes, that's what
I was going for.

1072
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,089
You're a fucking idiot.

1073
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,158
Fucking stop it, okay?

1074
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,295
Gunderson,
you are a shit-face,
you know that?

1075
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:15,264
You're an inconsiderate
shit pile!

1076
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,033
All right.
You know what?

1077
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18,601
You know what?

1078
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:23,105
I wish that I let
your stuff burn up
in that room.

1079
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:24,740
You fucking...

1080
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,577
(Laughing)
Ow!

1081
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:30,880
Cut it out, guys.

1082
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,515
Billy: You son of a...

1083
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,184
So civil.

1084
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,252
What are you doing?

1085
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,554
Stop. Enough. Billy!

1086
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,389
Jake: Leave him alone!
Get off of him!
I will pummel you!

1087
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,625
All right. Fine! It was me!
All right, it was me!

1088
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,060
I did it.
Not gunderson, me.

1089
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,128
It was me!

1090
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,165
Stop it!
It wasn't gunderson!

1091
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,767
I ruined your stuff!
All right?

1092
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,139
(Sighs) I destroyed
your stuff, all right?
I'm sorry.

1093
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:59,208
It's true. It wasn't me.

1094
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,777
Jake: I was hammered.
I mean...

1095
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,046
I was shit-faced
and I thought
it'd be funny.

1096
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,848
I had no idea

1097
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,718
that the foam
in those extinguishers

1098
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,654
cause so much damage.
I thought they were...

1099
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:12,855
What?

1100
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:14,390
Gunderson wasn't
even with me.

1101
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,525
You just immediately
assumed it was him.

1102
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:19,495
I got to say,
I admired your work

1103
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,564
and was happy
to take credit for it.

1104
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,366
I can't believe
you took the blame
this whole time.

1105
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:24,333
Jake: It was dick
thing to do, Billy.

1106
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:26,269
I should've
told you sooner

1107
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:28,671
and I will totally
pay you back
for everything

1108
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:31,908
that was damaged,
with interest.

1109
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,576
Wow, feels good.

1110
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,045
That actually
feels good.
It's a relief.

1111
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:38,414
(Chuckles)
Dragging that around
for so long.

1112
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,856
It's good. It's nice...
Nice feeling.

1113
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,617
(Sighs)

1114
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,121
There's one other thing
I need to tell you.

1115
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:46,622
About the walk.

1116
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,424
And tabatha (Laughs)

1117
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,946
(Sighs) Guys, no offense,

1118
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,380
but, you're
not invited, all right?

1119
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:13,049
I need to do this
on my own.

1120
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,518
Damn it,
that's broken. (Sighs)

1121
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,120
Let the record show

1122
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,656
that I'm no longer
in this to keep
Jake in New York.

1123
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:23,092
Excuse me? You're trying
to keep me in New York?

1124
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,794
Well, it was.
Now, I just wanna
make sure

1125
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:26,996
that you and tabatha
never get back together.

1126
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:28,431
Are you fucking with me?

1127
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:30,433
You're trying to break
tabatha and me up?

1128
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:32,134
You guys aren't
together now. (Laughs)

1129
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,570
Not current...
You know what I mean,
for crying out loud.

1130
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:35,972
You guys
are awful together.

1131
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,140
You're worse
than heathcliff and Cathy.

1132
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,276
I was always
more of a Garfield
man myself.

1133
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:41,644
I'm just looking
out for you.

1134
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,479
You don't need
to look out.
I can look after my...

1135
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,114
You know what,
I had the stupid idea

1136
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:47,016
that maybe you'd be
happy for me. God, stupid.

1137
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:48,317
I was happy
for you, Jake,

1138
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,152
when I thought
we're gonna be
out adventuring.

1139
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,787
All right.
Why don't we just meet
up with each other

1140
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:53,522
in a couple
of hours and grab
a drink then, huh?

1141
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,524
How's that sound? Rocks,
drinks in a couple of hours?

1142
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:57,426
No? He's drunk.

1143
00:49:57,428 --> 00:49:59,362
What's your big plan
anyway? Aren't you
leaving tomorrow?

1144
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:01,597
Yeah. I don't know.
Maybe we'll do
a long-distance thing.

1145
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,833
Maybe I won't
leave, I don't know.

1146
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:04,967
Really? Seriously?

1147
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,502
It's possible.
I don't know, Billy!

1148
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,604
I just know that
I've never been happier

1149
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:10,139
than I was
when I was with her.

1150
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:11,340
That is not true,
all right?

1151
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,875
Life sucked back then

1152
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,712
You know what,
I didn't want to have
to do this, but you...

1153
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:19,015
You leave me
no choice. All right?

1154
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,684
Oh, come on!

1155
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,821
I'm on your tail!
Fuck's sake!
Guys, guys, guys!

1156
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:28,024
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Okay, okay, fine.

1157
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:29,692
You can come,
but for fuck's sake,

1158
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,627
just please, please,
behave yourselves.

1159
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:32,728
Who you're
talking to?

1160
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,330
Of course, we will.
Yeah.

1161
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,731
And we're gonna
need to bring wine.

1162
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:36,999
And you're paying.

1163
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:38,534
Okay. Well, we are
near my office.

1164
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,735
There's a place a
couple of blocks down

1165
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,170
that we've got
an expense account.

1166
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:42,304
Great.

1167
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,907
I need a cupcake.

1168
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,078
Just real quick.

1169
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,581
The... I know
the fire extinguisher
debacle was Jake,

1170
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,717
but I'm still
gonna blame you.

1171
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,553
Impressive,
and I accept.

1172
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,158
Billy: Come on, Jake,
just one.
Jake: No.

1173
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,893
Billy: Please! Jake.
Jake: No.

1174
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:06,796
Jake, Jake, Jake,
Jake, Jake, Jake,
Jake, Jake.

1175
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:08,931
Real quick.
Ugh...

1176
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:11,033
Fine. All right.
A robber walks
into your house,

1177
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:12,601
puts a gun to your head,
he says<i> Sophie's choice.</i>

1178
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,236
Option one is

1179
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:17,907
you have to gain
and lose 30 pounds
every month

1180
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,008
for the rest
of your life, or...
Oh.

1181
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,277
Or option two,
you could stop making him

1182
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,112
play this stupid game.

1183
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:25,748
Gunderson, will you just
shut the fuck up?
Billy?

1184
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,683
Mr. Kim.

1185
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:29,518
Larry, please.
How are you feeling?

1186
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:32,321
Not good.

1187
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:35,458
I am coughing up blood.

1188
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,759
Oh, dear, really?

1189
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,627
No. No.

1190
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:39,995
I don't know
why I just said that.

1191
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,031
I see.

1192
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:44,366
Yeah. No, I just...
I just... you know.

1193
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:46,502
I thought
I'd pick up a wine

1194
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,537
on my way
to the doctor.

1195
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,639
It's not exactly
on the way.

1196
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:51,774
No, it is not.

1197
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,110
That's true.

1198
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,878
(Clicks)

1199
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,480
And my friends
are here, too.

1200
00:51:57,482 --> 00:51:59,315
We're not his friends.

1201
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,119
You know,
I just wanted to...

1202
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,721
Wanted to pick
up a bottle,

1203
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:08,624
little something
to wet the palette.

1204
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:11,327
It's just
a little parched.

1205
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,929
Next time,
you wanna spend the day

1206
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:15,431
horsing around
with your friends...

1207
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:17,466
Oh, Mr. Kim, that's...
I get it.

1208
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,468
I do. Just...

1209
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:21,203
Next time
tell me the truth.

1210
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:23,572
Okay? (Laughs)

1211
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,408
(Laughs)

1212
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:32,748
Nailed it.

1213
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,250
Congratulations, you got
away with it.

1214
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,918
What the hell,
I mean, was that?

1215
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,486
I mean, is he serious?

1216
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,688
He seems perfect.

1217
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,824
Hey, where is Jake?

1218
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,429
(Sighs) Bumblebees.

1219
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,044
Gunderson: (High-pitched)
Surprise!

1220
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:03,712
Oh, no. Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
Billy: Hey.

1221
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:05,648
What are you doing
here? Please, no.

1222
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,017
For me? Thank you.
(Door opens)

1223
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,485
Billy: Hi.
Gunderson: These are
for you.

1224
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:12,321
Hey! Oh! Hey,
good to see you.
Hey.

1225
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:15,357
Tab, hey, hey.
Thank you. What?

1226
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,528
(Rocks clears throat)

1227
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,497
Rocks: Here's the answer.

1228
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:23,732
You sleep
with Helen Keller

1229
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:26,101
because of
the heightened
sense of touch.

1230
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:29,004
You should kill Amelia earhart

1231
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:31,173
because there would
finally be a body.
Oh.

1232
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:33,042
And there
would be closure.
Ah, that's a sweet story.

1233
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:34,476
There'd be closure.

1234
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:37,846
And then,
you're gonna marry
no one, actually.

1235
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:39,048
Because that one
was a trick question.

1236
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,649
Because how
do you know
someone well enough

1237
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:41,617
to marry them?
You don't.
(People laughing)

1238
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:44,220
Oh, yeah.
I'd probably sleep
with all of them.

1239
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:46,488
And then, maybe
one would die
accidentally.

1240
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,923
Thus solving two thirds
of the problem.
(Woman laughs)

1241
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:50,092
Man 1: Oh, very nice.
Man 2: No, very daft.

1242
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:51,427
Classy, dad, classy.

1243
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:53,963
Woman: But, wait,
wait, wait. Tell...
Now, tell me.

1244
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:56,599
It's how long,
this walk?

1245
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:59,335
The walk
is 260 blocks.

1246
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:01,103
Oh.
It's about 15 Miles.

1247
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,505
Oh, that's marvelous!

1248
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,075
(Gasps) I'm envious.

1249
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,877
You guys are
on a walkabout?

1250
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:09,945
It's just four guys

1251
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,781
getting...
I wouldn't call it a...

1252
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,003
It doesn't
have to be a walkabout.

1253
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,685
Tabatha: No,
I mean that
in a good way.

1254
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:18,854
I don't mean
to devalue... look.

1255
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,422
I'll plead my case
for you.

1256
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,690
Um...

1257
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:23,692
Throughout time,
throughout history,

1258
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,594
there has been...
Before man began...

1259
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:26,795
Yes.
Right, okay.

1260
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,364
Take it way back,
to the beginning.
Um...

1261
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:30,366
There's always been
something to signify

1262
00:54:30,368 --> 00:54:33,035
the mechanism of
men going

1263
00:54:33,037 --> 00:54:34,536
from childhood
to adulthood.

1264
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:35,571
There's always
been something.

1265
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:37,640
There's been
a trek, a hunt,

1266
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:38,874
a whore,
whatever it is,

1267
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:39,942
there is this...
Or all three.

1268
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:42,378
There we go, or...
Now, there's nothing.
Right.

1269
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,879
There's whores.
There's nothing.

1270
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:45,147
What in this culture
signifies that

1271
00:54:45,149 --> 00:54:46,181
for men?
(Women laughing)

1272
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,717
See, Billy, that's why
you're still a child.

1273
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:50,552
You don't have
that mechanism

1274
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:52,755
that will make you
into an adult.

1275
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:54,390
I had a bar mitzvah.
(Man laughs)

1276
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:55,724
Gunderson: Bar mitzvah.

1277
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:57,926
Tabatha: Okay.
And for women it's just,
you know, it's...

1278
00:54:57,928 --> 00:54:59,628
There is, like,
an internal clock

1279
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,830
there's something
very different
for women.

1280
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:03,165
It's biological.

1281
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,901
Rocks: I don't think that
not knowing how to grow up

1282
00:55:05,903 --> 00:55:07,736
or having difficulty
with that.

1283
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:09,605
Is that new
a concept, necessarily.

1284
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:11,907
No, no.
Also, I would...
Also I think that

1285
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:15,077
saying that women mature
better than men is...
(Emits fart noise)

1286
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,645
Whoa! I did not
say that.

1287
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,647
I was not saying...
Man: If I may,

1288
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,851
perhaps the idea that we
ever grow up is flawed.

1289
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,888
Adults, children,
children, adults.

1290
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:29,825
We are all both, at once!
Mmm-hmm.

1291
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:33,729
I would say, it feels good
to think otherwise.

1292
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:37,199
But, just because
you feel good,

1293
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,435
does not make it so.

1294
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,837
Huh?
(Laughs) Mmm-hmm.

1295
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:45,641
Dan, your wisdom never ceases
to amaze, yet confuse me.

1296
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:47,209
All: (Chuckling)
Tabatha: Hear, hear.

1297
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:50,546
The more you drink,
the smarter I get.
All: (Laughing)

1298
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:52,815
You know what?
I have a game.

1299
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:54,483
I think everybody is
going to love this game.

1300
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:56,485
I can't take credit
for this game.

1301
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:58,654
It's not my game.
It's actually Jake's game!

1302
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:00,723
Billy: Jake's game!
Jake came up with this.

1303
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,458
This is all Jake.

1304
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,893
A robber bursts
into your home,

1305
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:07,129
puts a gun to your head,

1306
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,231
and says, "you have
two options,

1307
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:11,233
Jake: Hey, hey.
Come on man, no.
"Or I kill you."

1308
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:17,373
You leave the city
that you have called
your home for so long.

1309
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,708
You have to leave it.
You can never return.

1310
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,810
Or option two.

1311
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,813
You can stay in
that city you love

1312
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:27,816
but you have to stay in
a loveless relationship.

1313
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:32,020
Someone who your friends,
everyone in your life,

1314
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:34,757
knows this person
is bad for you.

1315
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:37,893
Trying to shape you
and mold you into
something that you are not.

1316
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,231
So her only goal...
So sorry guys.

1317
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:46,101
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
That was on me.

1318
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,823
That was on me.
There's a bathroom upstairs.

1319
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:58,447
Are you serious?

1320
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,095
I was just, I'm looking for
the bathroom, and your room

1321
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,530
snuck up on me.

1322
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:15,664
The panty drawer's in there.

1323
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,266
The panty drawer?
Uh-huh.

1324
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:19,635
Yeah.

1325
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:22,271
What I was trying to
say to you before

1326
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:24,540
just so you understand,
is it's not that women

1327
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,644
necessarily grow up
better than men.

1328
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:32,614
It's just that, their path
to adulthood is... different.

1329
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,352
I don't give a shit and
I was just being contrary.

1330
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,888
Hmm.

1331
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,492
So this is the room then, huh?
This is.

1332
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:45,661
This is my childhood bedroom.

1333
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,831
It is exactly
the way I left it.

1334
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,666
That's nice.

1335
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:53,402
Mine's pretty much the same.
It's got a treadmill
in it now.

1336
00:57:53,404 --> 00:57:54,404
Yeah.

1337
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:03,312
I don't want to freak you out,
but there's six enormous
faces looking at us.

1338
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:04,913
Who are they?
What's their story?

1339
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,495
Tabatha: You know what?
Rocks: They seem...

1340
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,418
Tabatha: I have...

1341
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:13,422
A story for you.

1342
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,993
(Music playing)

1343
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:31,440
Just doesn't make sense.

1344
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:36,678
I mean, I lied repeatedly
and then directly to
Mr. Kim's face,

1345
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,080
and then, nothing.

1346
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:46,288
It's funny. I don't remember
inquiring about you,
in any kind of way.

1347
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,856
It's just unsettling.

1348
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,058
That's, that's the word
that I would use.

1349
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,360
Fine, I'll bite.

1350
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:56,298
Billy, you got away with it.
What's the big deal?

1351
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,801
It's just that
the universe has an order.

1352
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:02,137
Your transgressions
must be punished.

1353
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:04,973
Without that order,
there's... chaos.

1354
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,476
You really are a
simple, simple boy.

1355
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,581
Have you seen her?
Huh?

1356
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:14,729
Tabatha. Have you seen her?
Billy: No.

1357
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:16,952
Asshole. You don't care.

1358
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,587
Neither of you care.

1359
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:22,257
What are you even doing here?
I asked you not to...
I begged you not to come.

1360
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:25,294
You. You!
That stunt you pulled
at dinner, come on man.

1361
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,863
I'm going through an
existential crisis here.

1362
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:29,264
You can't go...
Whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

1363
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:31,733
You are not going through
an existential crisis.

1364
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:35,737
An existential crisis means
that your whole existence
is being called into question.

1365
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,240
What you're dealing with,
are transitional issues.

1366
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,389
Is that really what
existential means?

1367
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,511
Yes.

1368
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,112
Oh.

1369
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:47,509
You don't have to yell at me.

1370
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,304
I didn't yell at you.
That was yelling.

1371
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:54,323
So for my birthday,
my dad bought me
mmm-hmm.

1372
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:56,425
A holga camera.

1373
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,994
It was my first camera ever.

1374
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:03,131
And, this photograph
was taken

1375
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,702
the first time that I ever
heard my parents having sex.

1376
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,104
Okay.

1377
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:10,339
(Chuckles)

1378
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:12,574
I heard all these
sounds and...

1379
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,310
I knew it was significant

1380
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:18,614
so I ran back
and I got my camera
and I got a tripod.

1381
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:20,916
And I stood outside
and I faced away
from the door.

1382
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:23,118
And I looked
and I took the picture.

1383
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,288
What a weirdo.
What a weirdo.
I know.

1384
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,556
I know, right.

1385
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:31,760
And you would
not, not frame that

1386
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:33,695
and put it on your wall
because...

1387
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,965
It's a keeper,
and you put it up
on your wall.

1388
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,133
I didn't frame it.

1389
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,802
Well, it's in a frame.

1390
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,104
I know, they framed it.

1391
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:43,805
They framed it.
They framed it.

1392
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,574
Yeah.
So sick.

1393
01:00:45,576 --> 01:00:47,909
And did you tell them
honestly what it is.

1394
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:49,591
Do they know
what they framed?
I don't know.

1395
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,513
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

1396
01:00:51,515 --> 01:00:52,614
I don't want
to know, either.

1397
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:53,649
(Laughing)

1398
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,186
God! I'm worried
about her.

1399
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,788
Maybe she's got diarrhea.

1400
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,156
You know, sometimes
when she drinks too
much coffee,

1401
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:02,491
her stomach
can get a little...

1402
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:03,825
How about this one?

1403
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,495
A robber shoots you
in the head.

1404
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:08,964
Says,<i> "Sophie's choice.</i>

1405
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:11,566
"Play chess with the dog
or scrabble with the cat."

1406
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,202
Hmm.

1407
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,371
I don't think
you understand
how this game is played.

1408
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,040
Oh! (Laughing)

1409
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,676
I'm gonna get some scotch.

1410
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,046
I'm gonna take a shit.

1411
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,354
You know, Jake,
you're a good egg.

1412
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,357
Well, that is true, sir.

1413
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,126
You know what
you should do?

1414
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:42,631
Marry my daughter,
have babies

1415
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:44,199
and name one after me.

1416
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,571
(Laughing)

1417
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:50,806
(Chuckles skeptically)

1418
01:01:50,808 --> 01:01:52,174
Ow.

1419
01:01:52,176 --> 01:01:53,375
Oh, boy.

1420
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:56,712
(Laughing) Wine stain?

1421
01:01:56,714 --> 01:01:58,213
Yeah. Let's not go down...
This really...

1422
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,815
That's really
quite a mess.

1423
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:01,216
That's quite unfortunate.

1424
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,251
Looking for...
Oh, I could get you a shirt.

1425
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:04,753
I need to borrow a...

1426
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:07,456
Back, back under
the mattress
where it belongs.

1427
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:09,491
A thoroughly
bad choice...

1428
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:18,300
I don't know why...
I've...

1429
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:20,736
Tabatha...
Here's your picture.

1430
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,672
Can you...
I'm so.

1431
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:26,908
That's my fault.
I'm sorry.

1432
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,355
One, have a threesome
with a couple twice your age

1433
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:43,658
or two, masturbate
in front of a room
full of strangers.

1434
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:46,862
(Laughing)

1435
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:56,738
We should go.

1436
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,540
Oh, God, yes.

1437
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:06,948
Jake: I don't get it.
I thought you invited me

1438
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,283
around so
we could talk.

1439
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:11,319
Jake, I... just...
I don't think...

1440
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,357
(Sighs)

1441
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:19,628
Do you remember this?

1442
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,465
Oh, my God.

1443
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:24,633
From our first date.

1444
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,068
Do you remember?

1445
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,906
I saved it, obviously.
And I...

1446
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,941
(Chuckling)

1447
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,676
I framed it and...

1448
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:36,711
Anyway...
(Laughs) Look at that.

1449
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,222
I thought I was really
fucked up for the last
couple of days.

1450
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:54,329
Hmm, but I think
I've been fucked up
for a long time, maybe.

1451
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,403
So...

1452
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,338
Damn.

1453
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,208
You need to
finish your walk.

1454
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,676
Tabby, hey.

1455
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,719
(Clears throat)
All right.

1456
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:19,521
All right, all right,
guys, let's go.

1457
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:20,589
Rocks: Yeah.

1458
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:44,913
Gunderson: You liked living
in hell's kitchen?

1459
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:46,514
Jake: Yeah,
the noodle place.

1460
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:49,150
You remember that...
Must have taken you there
a thousand times.

1461
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:50,886
Billy: You sure there
wasn't one here on
the lower east side?

1462
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:52,487
Jake: No, no, no.
That was a donut shop.

1463
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:53,989
You're thinking
about a donut place.

1464
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:55,824
Jake: Oh, east village.
Remember that
east village place

1465
01:04:55,826 --> 01:04:57,225
with the weird door man?
Sounds like roland...

1466
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,261
Rudolph.
Rudolph.

1467
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:00,829
Gunderson: The guy was always
giving me mix-tapes.

1468
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:02,697
Jake: (Laughs) Oh, God!

1469
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,099
Jake: You know, I don't
think I've ever not loved

1470
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:05,567
a neighborhood
in this city.

1471
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,604
Jake: (Sighs) Man,
I really don't
wanna leave.

1472
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:11,239
Billy: Then don't.

1473
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:13,742
Billy: We could
just go to a park.

1474
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:15,644
Jake: It'll be worth it,
trust me.

1475
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,773
(Shouting)

1476
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:35,256
Okay.

1477
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:37,826
You guys
are gonna love this.

1478
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:39,995
Oh, goddamn it.

1479
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:41,329
Oh.

1480
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:45,433
Oh, shit.

1481
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:47,268
That's an
interesting choice.

1482
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,671
Jake: God damn, taggers.
Ruined it.

1483
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,007
My breasts are nice.
When did you make this?

1484
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:54,075
Couple months ago.

1485
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,445
They're turning the whole
place into a hotel.

1486
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,948
So I kinda had
this stupid idea that

1487
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:03,018
you know,
that we could live on,
our legacy or something.

1488
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,720
Jake: (Sighs) God.

1489
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:08,790
Nothing about this day
has turned out the
way I wanted it to.

1490
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,191
Well, the day's not over.

1491
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,395
We can salvage this,
we'll go to a bar,
have a few drinks.

1492
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:15,063
I kissed tabatha.

1493
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:17,799
What?

1494
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,970
Me and tabatha,
we kissed.

1495
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:24,005
What are you
talking about?

1496
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:25,907
You did not.
No, we did.

1497
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:27,709
Fuck you, you did not.

1498
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,445
It happened.

1499
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:32,647
When?

1500
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:34,416
Rocks: In her old bedroom.

1501
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,651
Not where. When.

1502
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:38,086
After dinner.
Okay.

1503
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,455
Why?
I don't know.

1504
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:43,825
I don't know.
Just tell me why?

1505
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:47,162
I'm not mad.
I just want
to know why.

1506
01:07:47,164 --> 01:07:48,396
Because
I'm a fucking
piece of shit.

1507
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,098
Uh-huh.
Why else?

1508
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,100
Jake, Jake,
come on, Jake.

1509
01:07:52,102 --> 01:07:53,334
I don't know.
Jake, let go.

1510
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:54,669
You fucking know.
I don't.

1511
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:56,438
Billy: Jake...
You fucking know.

1512
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,606
You do know.
You do know!

1513
01:07:58,608 --> 01:07:59,908
Why did you do it?

1514
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:04,079
Billy: Come on, Jake, Jake.
Come on, Jake. Jake.

1515
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,450
Smooth, rocks,
really smooth.

1516
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:12,454
It was probably
just a little drunken kiss.

1517
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:14,689
Like a peck.
No.

1518
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:17,051
Sure, I mean,
it was a momentary lapse.
You weren't thinking.

1519
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:20,061
I wish that were true.
I do.
Billy: It is.

1520
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:21,463
Jake is overreacting.
And...

1521
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:22,797
No, Billy, stop.

1522
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,065
I know you,
you would never...

1523
01:08:24,067 --> 01:08:25,733
Stop it.
It's not a big deal...

1524
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:28,670
Billy, Jesus Christ,
I messed up, okay?

1525
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,005
I'm not perfect.

1526
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:46,521
What the hell
is going on today?

1527
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:07,809
You okay, shit head?

1528
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:16,584
Do you realize
that the last time that
we all hung out together

1529
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:19,721
as a group
was at my birthday
last year.

1530
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:25,193
What do you care
if I stay or if I go.

1531
01:09:25,195 --> 01:09:26,628
What does it matter to you.

1532
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,596
Come on,
of course it does.
We're not...

1533
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:29,931
...friends anymore.

1534
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,521
Billy: Is it true about
the birthday thing?

1535
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:42,844
Jesus.

1536
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,453
(Ringing)

1537
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,056
Emma:<i> Leave a message.</i>
(Beeps)

1538
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:57,892
Hey, em. It's me.
I think you're
with your sister.

1539
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,229
I'm just calling to say
that we got done early

1540
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:03,551
and I just wanted to see
what you're up to,
where you're at.

1541
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:07,802
It's been
a pretty crazy day...

1542
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:09,304
I'm calling from
a pay phone,

1543
01:10:09,306 --> 01:10:10,738
because I broke my phone

1544
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,860
so I guess I'll just give
you a try again later. Okay.

1545
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,547
(Sighs)

1546
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,748
God, please
call me back,
all right?

1547
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:24,152
I really, I really
need to fucking
talk to you.

1548
01:10:24,154 --> 01:10:26,487
All right, rocks
told me everything.

1549
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:27,755
And...

1550
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:34,762
(Door closes)

1551
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,433
(Throws down keys)

1552
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:41,135
(Thumping)

1553
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,338
This place is ridiculous.

1554
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,639
(Sighs)

1555
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,741
You deserve none of this.

1556
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,077
I'm so tired.

1557
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,087
(Line ringing)

1558
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,256
Hey, Larry.

1559
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,124
Yeah.

1560
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,594
I just wanted to call
and apologize
for earlier.

1561
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:09,430
You're totally right.
I should have
just told the truth.

1562
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:14,235
Yeah, but the thing is...
About this merger.

1563
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:17,605
Honestly,
I'm completely
and utterly beat

1564
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,608
and I think
I'm gonna need
tomorrow to recover.

1565
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,213
Yeah, I understand
we've got the deadline.

1566
01:11:25,215 --> 01:11:26,581
I don't want to
slow things down

1567
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,049
so why don't you just
take me off the team
on this

1568
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:29,617
and I will go get
them next time.

1569
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:33,955
Okay, thanks
for understanding.

1570
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:36,891
(Sighs)

1571
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:39,427
What?

1572
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:41,863
Nice work.

1573
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:48,803
(Cell phone ringing)

1574
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:50,471
Huh.

1575
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,474
Emma's sister.
Weird.

1576
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,143
Hello?

1577
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:57,745
No, I haven't seen...

1578
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:00,848
What? Yeah, okay.

1579
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,551
(Techno music playing)

1580
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,067
Man: Where is he?

1581
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:28,710
Hi.

1582
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:30,511
Hey.
Bartender: Hey.

1583
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:32,513
Water. No ice.

1584
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:35,283
And keep it coming.

1585
01:12:35,285 --> 01:12:37,085
All right.

1586
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,427
(Car alarm blaring)

1587
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:57,638
I haven't seen him
in like three hours.

1588
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,041
I don't...
How am I supposed
to know where...

1589
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:03,444
Let me call you back.

1590
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,613
What's up?

1591
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:08,149
(Laughs)

1592
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:10,551
So simple.

1593
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:18,760
Rocks. (Laughs)

1594
01:13:18,762 --> 01:13:19,827
(Whistles for cab)

1595
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,631
(Inaudible)

1596
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,005
(Sighs)

1597
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:14,315
(Urinating)

1598
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,920
(Gasps)

1599
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:56,824
I copied him.

1600
01:14:58,026 --> 01:14:59,494
(Horn blaring)

1601
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:10,505
(Keys clattering)

1602
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:46,040
(Cell phone ringing)

1603
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:49,544
Yeah.

1604
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:50,912
(Siren wails)

1605
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:00,121
(Elevator bell dings)

1606
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:05,560
Hi, Emma,
Emma Bryant.

1607
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:07,762
Her water broke,
she came in
a few hours ago.

1608
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:09,063
I'm the father.

1609
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:11,899
Miss Bryant?
Yeah.

1610
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:16,170
She's recovering.
She's recovering?

1611
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:18,072
Don't worry, she's fine.

1612
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:20,141
Your son was born
45 minutes ago.

1613
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:22,977
I missed it.

1614
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,081
Are you sure?

1615
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:28,849
Pretty sure.

1616
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,285
What room are they in?
Where are they? Stat.

1617
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:33,788
6820.
6820, okay.

1618
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,008
(Sighs)

1619
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,059
(Woman paging for doctor)

1620
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:21,135
Hey.

1621
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,239
Man, I'm so sorry.

1622
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:27,341
I'm sorry.

1623
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:33,581
Thanks for coming.
(Whispers) Hey.

1624
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:35,149
You guys wanna
meet my son?

1625
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:38,586
Yes.

1626
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:48,629
Oh...

1627
01:17:48,631 --> 01:17:49,864
(Baby cooing)

1628
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,200
(Singing softly)

1629
01:17:57,773 --> 01:17:59,106
No, man,
I wouldn't know.

1630
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:03,744
(Cooing)

1631
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:07,682
(Baby cries)

1632
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,920
Yeah, baby...

1633
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,156
(Softly) Oh, cute.

1634
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:16,891
(Makes popping sound)
(Laughs)

1635
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:21,262
Can I try it?

1636
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:25,533
(Babies crying)

1637
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:40,114
I'm gonna
grab some food.

1638
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:41,882
Hmm.

1639
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,527
Hey.

1640
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:55,563
Harry, I got
a secret for you.

1641
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:57,832
You wanna know
why we call
your dad rocks?

1642
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:59,700
He literally has just these,

1643
01:18:59,702 --> 01:19:04,138
nasty, gigantic,
Godzilla sized testicles.

1644
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,907
(Laughs) So there it is.

1645
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,744
You know, that's the
kinda stuff you learn about
your college roommate.

1646
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:12,613
Most of it is...
(Clears throat) Disgusting.

1647
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:14,515
So...

1648
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,417
All right, what else.

1649
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,954
Not too much pain?
(Laughs)

1650
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:23,090
Hanging in.

1651
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,295
I should've been there.

1652
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:30,264
I should've been there.
I'm so sorry.

1653
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:35,169
I wasn't mad.

1654
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,171
How can you say that?

1655
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:51,385
I just wasn't...

1656
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:39,500
Jake:<i> What else can</i>
<i>I tell you guys?</i>

1657
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:42,203
Your parents will probably
tell you that you're special.

1658
01:20:42,205 --> 01:20:44,471
But chances are,
you're not.

1659
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:46,774
Unique, yeah, sure,
I can buy that.

1660
01:20:46,776 --> 01:20:49,610
But not special,
come on.

1661
01:20:49,612 --> 01:20:51,772
Just because
you can draw doesn't
mean you're an artist.

1662
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:54,648
And there is no such
thing as a permanent record.

1663
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,217
So have some fun
in elementary school.

1664
01:20:56,219 --> 01:20:57,551
Yeah, you.

1665
01:20:57,553 --> 01:20:59,320
Columbus didn't
discover America

1666
01:20:59,322 --> 01:21:01,689
and the guy was
kind of an asshole.

1667
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:03,958
And trust me
when I tell you,
that your parents,

1668
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:07,228
are only looking out
for your best interests, okay?

1669
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:10,965
You know, I...

1670
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,567
I...

1671
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:16,036
So call them once in a while.

1672
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:28,315
You know, believe me
on that one because...

1673
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:29,617
I'm telling you.

1674
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:33,053
There will be a time.

1675
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:34,555
When you can't anymore.

1676
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,261
So, you know...

1677
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:43,197
I know it's a hassle.

1678
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,399
You don't even
need any excuse.

1679
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,734
Just call and say hi.

1680
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:53,574
(Sighs)

1681
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,682
Hey, buddy,
can we leave for a bit?

1682
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:05,586
Emma is sleeping,
why, what's up.

1683
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:07,922
I think we got
to do one last thing.

1684
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:46,460
Thank you.

1685
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:53,500
I got that.

1686
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:56,136
Here, thanks.

1687
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:02,810
So...

1688
01:23:02,812 --> 01:23:05,179
She really wasn't upset
that you weren't there?

1689
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,515
(Sighs) I think
we've both known

1690
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:12,353
for a while now,
no matter how much we want to,
we're just not in love.

1691
01:23:12,355 --> 01:23:14,321
Maybe we never were.

1692
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,357
But everything
is gonna work out,
right?

1693
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,126
I think so, now, yeah.

1694
01:23:19,128 --> 01:23:20,227
In a way.

1695
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,332
This is a fun story.

1696
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:29,336
Tonight, at the dinner party,
I shat in the bath tub.

1697
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:30,771
(Laughing)

1698
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:33,007
You did not.

1699
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,472
(All whooping)

1700
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:08,075
(Laughing)

1701
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:11,445
Whoo-hoo!

1702
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:15,783
(All whooping)

1703
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:28,395
(Exhales) Awesome.

1704
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:38,906
(Sighs)

1705
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:45,446
(Splashes)

1706
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,988
Jake: Hey, I really
appreciate what you
guys did for me today.

1707
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:00,694
Even you, kinda.

1708
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,330
But...

1709
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:06,266
I'm still leaving.

1710
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,670
I have to. I got to move on
I gotta...

1711
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:12,272
Face the future, you know.

1712
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,310
Good.

1713
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:18,612
Good?

1714
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:21,381
Good.

1715
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,450
Good riddance.

1716
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:25,119
(Chuckles)
