1
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,558
# Holdin' hands at midnight
'neath a starry sky #

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,636
# Nice work if you can get it #

3
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,598
# And you can get it
if you try #

4
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,192
# Strollin' with that one girl,
sighin' sigh after sigh #

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,999
# Nice work if you can get it #

6
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,755
# And you can get it
if you try #

7
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,756
# Just imagine someone
waitin' at the cottage door #

8
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,751
# Where two hearts become one #

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,037
- # Who could ask
for anything more? #
- Mmm!

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,269
That looks good enough to eat.

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,918
Oh, thank you.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,797
I wasn't talking about the cake.

13
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,440
Oh, Gordon. You're my cousin.

14
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,317
Never stopped
the Royal Family.

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,515
You're a very sick man.

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,875
Mm. Hi.

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,439
- Hi.
- You're yummy.

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,557
Oh, Mum, would you take Grandma
over to the church, please?

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,198
Yes. Come on, sweetheart.

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,599
So, do you wanna go and
tell Dennis that we're ready?

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,272
Sure thing.

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,315
How's he doing?

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,038
Oh, great. Thrilled.

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,470
I'm telling you, he's thrilled.

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,236
Dennis, it's Gordon.
Are you ready?

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,717
Wow! You look great!

27
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,354
So, are you ready?

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,509
Um...

29
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,513
- Just...
- OK.

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,830
I'm gonna give you a minute
to, uh...

31
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,955
give you a minute.

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,668
No, no. I don't want to.

33
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,671
Done want to, ah...

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,915
Dennis!

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,468
It's time.
Dennis, we have to go.

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,389
Dennis!

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,475
Dennis!

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
# Where to promise
to love one... #

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,755
Dennis, we're gonna have a baby.

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,595
Dennis.

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,275
Dennis?

42
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,992
# Who could ask
for anything more? #

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,833
Aw, shit.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,274
Dennis!

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,239
Dennis!

46
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,789
# I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
if you're gettin' me wrong #

47
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,440
# But you're half a world away
with only one sock on #

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,318
# Now you're gettin' too much,
I don't want to play along #

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,073
# 'Cause all I really wanted
was a radio song #

50
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,673
# What is there to say #

51
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,749
# What is there to say?

52
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,068
# In a world so grey? #

53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,149
# In a world so grey #

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,597
# Why, oh, why, oh, why
are we singing it anyway? #

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,795
- Come on!
- # 'Cause you think I had #

56
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,552
- # A wind-up heart #
- Stop!

57
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,200
- # Then you must
have had plastic head #
- Come back!

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,271
- # Did you think
I had to play the part? #
- Give me a break!

59
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,113
# When you copied everything
I said? #

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,668
- # When the tide of love is out
and the rust begins to show #
- Whoo!

61
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,988
# You're cryin'
in your sleep #

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,069
# Scared of your shadow #

63
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,309
- # If you thought
this was forever #
- Ooh!

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,356
- Oh!
- # Dear,
I'm keeping you in mind #

65
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,475
Gotcha. Where is it?

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,515
Where's what?

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,555
You know what I'm talkin' about!

68
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,755
Ooh! Hey! Hey!

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,795
Ooh!

70
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,835
All right!

71
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,875
What do you
think this is, huh?

72
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,154
I've never seen those
before in my life.

73
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,071
Yeah, and you're
a fit, running type.

74
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,149
You bastard.

75
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,195
Don't.

76
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,269
Little shit!

77
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,475
There's nothing to see here,
people.

78
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,595
Ow!

79
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,595
Where's the bra?

80
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,715
What bra?

81
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,669
Whoo!

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,591
Come on, fat boy, run!

83
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,829
I'm not fat!

84
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,512
I'm just... I'm unfit.

85
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,915
Go on, then.

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,315
Ow!

87
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,468
Yes?

88
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,437
Could you let me in, please,
Mr G?

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,115
Who the hell are you?

90
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,156
You... Why are we...

91
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,276
It's Dennis Doyle
from downstairs.

92
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,191
Dennis Doyle from downstairs
is dead...

93
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,349
killed by his landlord.

94
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,634
- Do you know why?
- No.

95
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,678
Failure to pay the rent
in a timely fashion.

96
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,829
Dennis!

97
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,399
Hey, Maya.
Listen, can you tell your dad...

98
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,435
I'm in a bit of a hurry?

99
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,431
- Have you got any money?
- Maya, go inside!

100
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,239
And put something on.

101
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,068
Hello. Hello.

102
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,912
Yes?

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,035
Do you know what happened
to that landlord...

104
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,111
after he killed Dennis Doyle
from downstairs?

105
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,236
- No.
- They gave him a medal...

106
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,073
and a nice foot massage.

107
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,551
Hey, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.

108
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,870
Mr Ghoshdashtidar, wait...

109
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,756
Well, how is the old rascal?

110
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,832
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

111
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,035
You know Bilbo.

112
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,519
He's got
the whole place in an uproar.

113
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,192
Mm. Ah, well,
that should please him.

114
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,115
Jake, your dad's gonna be here
in a minute.

115
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,315
You ready?

116
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,879
Ready!

117
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,235
All right,
then keep your secrets.

118
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,958
Hey.

119
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,758
- # You give me tone #
- Hey.

120
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,831
# I'll like that #

121
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,592
Hey, how is it goin'?

122
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,511
- Oh, yeah.
- # All the chrome #

123
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,556
# Well, I'll like that #

124
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,949
Dennis. Yeah, Dennis.

125
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,155
# Do you run away? #

126
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,629
You like, uh, to have some sort
of drink with me?

127
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,039
Oh, what the hell. Let's...

128
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,395
Ow, shit!

129
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,674
Oh!

130
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,079
- Hah!
- Aah!

131
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,752
No. Oh, you got me!

132
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,909
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,194
- We're playing
hobbits and orcs.
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,429
Guess who's an orc?

135
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,439
Honey, would you mind, uh...

136
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,511
This kind of smarts. Can you?

137
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,635
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

138
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,869
I'm not finished
with you, Whit!

139
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,359
Yeah, one sec.

140
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,714
Uh, I thought his dad
was picking him up.

141
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,791
- What happened?
- Oh, what happened?

142
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,949
Dennis happened.

143
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,951
Mmm. Well, on the bright side...

144
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,315
- Hmm?
- You look astonishingly
beautiful today.

145
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,435
- Whit!
- Really.

146
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,555
Where have you been?

147
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,993
Hey.

148
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,115
- I was...
- Daddy!

149
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,872
Hey, snot-face!

150
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,234
Oh, please, don't call him that.

151
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,673
Why?
He is a snot-face, isn't he?

152
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,478
You are a snot-face,
aren't you? Huh?

153
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,709
Oh.

154
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,755
Aw!

155
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,353
Jake, that's disgusting.

156
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,793
Jake, that's disgusting.
Go on.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,479
- Toilet first.
- Mom!

158
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,869
Go on. Grab your jacket.

159
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,676
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago, Dennis.

160
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,193
Yeah, there was a bit
of a mix-up with the...

161
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,838
with the tickets, so...

162
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,035
Hey, you look really nice.

163
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,189
Did I get you that necklace?

164
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,350
No. It was a...

165
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,635
just a present
from someone... else.

166
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,836
- Who?
- Uh, me, actually.

167
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,875
Oh, yeah.

168
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,915
Huh?

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,558
It belonged to my grandmother.

170
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,675
Yeah.

171
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,475
Huh?

172
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,994
Dennis, this is
my good friend, Whit.

173
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,072
Whit, this is my...
Jake's dad, Dennis.

174
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,434
How you doin'?

175
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,719
Good, yeah.
You have soft hands.

176
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,949
Do you moisturize?

177
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,915
I do, actually.

178
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,715
Well, it's very nice
to meet you.

179
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,631
It's nice to finally put a face
to the name.

180
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,675
I'd have probably thought
you'd have...

181
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,193
you would have seen
one of our photos.

182
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,195
Oh, there aren't any.

183
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,875
- Hmm.
- Ready?

184
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,837
Yes. Let's go.

185
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,114
- Have fun.
- Yeah.

186
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,033
Dennis, you do have
the tickets, right?

187
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,759
Libby, credit me
with some intelligence.

188
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,229
Tickets!

189
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,311
Does anybody have any tickets?

190
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,674
Mate, my daughter's
not very well.

191
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,988
I've got a couple of
spare tickets if you want 'em.

192
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,513
Yes. Thank you so much.
How much?

193
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,635
Oh, whatever.

194
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,119
Uh, this is
all the money I have.

195
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,515
Yeah?

196
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,828
My son is gonna love me.

197
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,797
You want your son to love you?
Don't break the law.

198
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,711
Hey, that's entrapment!

199
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,358
Oh, God!

200
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,078
And that's brutality!

201
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,876
Libby, it's...
It was only a caution.

202
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,032
No. Uh, Libby, I'll...

203
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,155
- Bye, Dad.
- Libby.

204
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,239
So, do you work with Libby
at the bakery?

205
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,595
No.

206
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,588
We met at the bakery, though.

207
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,113
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

208
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,195
What?

209
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,555
No, I just was
a nervous wreck that day.

210
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,834
It took me
four chocolate eclairs...

211
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,559
and a macaroon just to get up
the courage to talk to her.

212
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,679
Uh, no, I work in
the financial district actually.

213
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,835
I'm a hedge fund manager
for Waterman Hughes.

214
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,148
Oh.

215
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,435
I do high-level security
analysis and operation...

216
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,839
for an upscale retail outlet.

217
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,273
Really?

218
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,078
Libby said
you were a security guard...

219
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,309
at a women's clothing store.

220
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,992
Yeah, that's what I said.

221
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,479
Right.

222
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,630
Uh, well, l...
I should probably get a cab.

223
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,312
I got a big run in the morning.

224
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,833
A big what?

225
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,673
A run... I'm training for
the Nike River Run next month.

226
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,715
The what-y what what?

227
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,994
The Nike River Run.

228
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,674
It's a... It's a marathon race
along the, uh, Thames River.

229
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,039
Why would you do that?

230
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,872
Uh, well, it's
a charity thing, you know?

231
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,915
Plus, I love to run.

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,594
I actually ran the London
Marathon a little while ago.

233
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,635
Oh, that's a coincidence.

234
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,675
Oh, yeah? How's that?

235
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,159
I watched it on the television.

236
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,275
- Ah.
- Well, the last hour.

237
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,952
I sleep in on a Sunday, so...

238
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,388
Right.

239
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,710
Um, well, look, you know...

240
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,791
I know these things can be
pretty awkward, you know?

241
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,359
I mean, you know,
you're Jake's dad...

242
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,671
and, uh, well,
I just want you to know...

243
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,357
that I like Libby and Jake
very, very much...

244
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,353
and, um, well, I just appreciate
your being so grown up...

245
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,589
about this, you know?

246
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,189
Hey! Yo!

247
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,474
You wanna take this one?

248
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,675
- No, you have it.
- You sure?

249
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,954
Yeah. I'll get the next one.

250
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,439
All right.
Very nice to meet you.

251
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,033
- Yeah.
- I'm sure I'll see you around.

252
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,872
Yup. Hope so.

253
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,679
Hello, good sir.
West India Quay, please.

254
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,035
- Bye.
- Bye.

255
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,553
- See ya.
- Bye-bye.

256
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,315
Dennis!

257
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,355
Dennis!

258
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,395
Dennis?

259
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,195
- Close your eyes.
- Huh?

260
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,713
- Close your eyes.
- Oh.

261
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,716
OK. Open them.
Happy Valentine's.

262
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,198
That's great.

263
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,675
Dennis!

264
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,349
Dennis!

265
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,075
Hi.

266
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,235
Hey, Vincent.

267
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,993
- Dennis.
- How's business?

268
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,069
Whatcha mean, "business"?

269
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,229
Sorry.

270
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,675
- Got it.
- Shh.

271
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,749
Hush now, man.

272
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,068
All right.

273
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,309
Three thousand.

274
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,754
This is all I've got.

275
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,351
Just throw whatever you have
in the pot.

276
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,396
OK.

277
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,595
Flush, king high.

278
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,669
Ace high.

279
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,873
What happened?

280
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,795
Bad luck, mate.

281
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,154
Oh.

282
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,792
Oh, hey, I got you
those tickets.

283
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,233
They were for yesterday.

284
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,275
What?
So now you don't want 'em?

285
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,759
Why would I want them?

286
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,675
Put them on eBay.

287
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,909
Who's gonna wanna buy tickets...

288
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,274
for something
that happened yesterday?

289
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,873
- Time travellers.
- Where were you?

290
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,076
My whole night
was just screwed, man...

291
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,072
and I looked like a prick in
front of Libby's new boyfriend.

292
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,878
Oh, she didn't tell me
she has a new boyfriend.

293
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,075
What's he like?

294
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,678
Handsome, well-off, friendly.

295
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,672
He's like Peter Perfect
out of Wacky Races...

296
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,988
and he runs marathons.

297
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,799
- Why?
- Exactly.

298
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,672
Well, look, my only
serious relationship ended...

299
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,035
in a broken collarbone
and a dead meerkat...

300
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,997
so I may not be the best person
in the world to give advice...

301
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,514
but you have been trying
to get through to Libby...

302
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,318
for five years now...

303
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,914
so maybe you should let her go.

304
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,558
Yeah,
but what is her problem?

305
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,199
Dennis, you left her
at the altar...

306
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,429
when she was pregnant.

307
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,839
But that was ages ago.

308
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,753
Well, women remember that stuff.

309
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,233
Look, if there's anything else
I can do to help...

310
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,992
just let me know.

311
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,071
Well, actually, I am
a little bit behind in my rent.

312
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,639
I was wondering if you had
a couple of hundred quid...

313
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,153
I could maybe borrow.

314
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,915
Oh, I love you. I really do.

315
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,797
I needed that actually.

316
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,996
That's great. Thank you.
I'll see you later.

317
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,075
How about this one?

318
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,075
I bet you can't do it.

319
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,992
- I can do a big one.
- Go on.

320
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,955
Look, look, look, look, look.

321
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,154
That was a good one.

322
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,275
Yeah.

323
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,994
Listen.

324
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,230
I'm really sorry about
gettin' you arrested yesterday.

325
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,275
That's all right.

326
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,588
Most universities
don't even look...

327
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,999
at things
like that these days.

328
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,234
Hey, another one.

329
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,958
As far as I'm concerned,
what else do you have?

330
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,598
- Oh, she was great.
- Yeah, well, she is...

331
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,954
Ooh!

332
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,108
- Shh.
- Sorry.

333
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,155
Um, but, yeah, so I think...

334
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,753
Do you want to hear a secret?

335
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,795
Absolutely.

336
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,598
There's a girl in my class
called Emily.

337
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,398
Well, I'm sure
that's not a secret.

338
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,959
The teachers probably know
about her.

339
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,234
She looks like a tree frog.

340
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,275
She what?

341
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,839
She looks like a tree frog.

342
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,751
That's not
a very nice thing to say.

343
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,114
I like tree frogs.

344
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,269
Oh, yeah?

345
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,395
More than hobbits?

346
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,914
I see.

347
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,150
I really feel
we can make a life together.

348
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,468
"You really think we could..."

349
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,391
Wait, that sounds like something
Whit would say.

350
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,754
He did say it.

351
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,876
- What? To Mom?
- Yes.

352
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,109
What a shithead.

353
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,155
Dad!

354
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,275
Sorry.

355
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,033
Listen, I'm really glad
you were such a big boy...

356
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,439
about not gettin'
into the whole...

357
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,669
Lord of the Rings thing,
you know?

358
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,715
That's OK.

359
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,199
Whit's got us front row seats
for tomorrow...

360
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,349
so it's even better.

361
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,873
What a shithead.

362
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,995
Dad!

363
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,395
Well.

364
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,315
# Ah, yeah #

365
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,315
# Oh, yeah #

366
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,153
# I'm up
on the eleventh floor #

367
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,674
# And I'm watchin'
the cruisers below #

368
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,639
# He's down on the street #

369
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,359
# And he's tryin' hard
to pull sister Flo #

370
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,637
# Oh, my heart's
in the basement #

371
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,314
# My weekend's
at an all-time low #

372
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,072
# 'Cause she's hopin' to score #

373
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,549
# So I can't see her
letting him go #

374
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,912
# You betcha #

375
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,319
# Oh, yeah #

376
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,435
# Uh-huh #

377
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,789
Deliveries are downstairs.

378
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,552
- No, I'm...
- Waterman Hughes.

379
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,513
- Yes?
- Bonjour.

380
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,309
Whit!

381
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,315
Thanks for your help.

382
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,918
So, what brings you
down here, man?

383
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,070
A little, uh, high-level
security analysis...

384
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,388
in retail operation?

385
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,549
Huh?

386
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,471
What can I do for you?
I'm just on my way to the gym.

387
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,835
- I got a spin class.
- Huh?

388
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,036
Spinning?
You know, spinning, bicycles?

389
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,075
Oh, OK.

390
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,151
No, I was thinking more
along the lines of a pint.

391
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,958
A pint? Oh, a pint.

392
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,837
Uh, wow.

393
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,638
Um, I'd love a pint, actually...

394
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,119
but, uh, I really gotta hit
this class.

395
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,633
I'm in training, you know?

396
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,948
You wanna come along?

397
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,632
Uh, it's an amazing workout.

398
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,676
L... I'd love to, but I don't
have any gear, so...

399
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,829
Well, I'll lend you some.

400
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,915
Great.

401
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,831
Three, two, one!

402
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,399
We're climbing!
Rhythm is up!

403
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,359
Push! Push! Push! Push!

404
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,873
Keep it up!

405
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,632
No cheating! Let's go!

406
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,039
How you doin' there?
You all right?

407
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,075
What'd you say?

408
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,151
Out of the saddle!
We're climbing!

409
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,832
OK,
let's make it really hard!

410
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,352
So, what did you wanna
talk to me about, man?

411
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,268
Ow!

412
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,670
Jake said you had some tickets
to the, uh...

413
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,273
to the hobbit musical.

414
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,078
Yeah, a friend of mine's
an investor in the show.

415
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,071
He totally hooked me up.
Can you believe that?

416
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,799
Hmm... um...

417
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,871
I was just thinking, um...

418
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,915
you know,
you don't really wanna sit...

419
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,992
through a whole sort of
three-hour kind of show, do you?

420
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,152
- So...
- Well, the thing is...

421
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,915
Oh.

422
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,995
Jake's really kind of got
his heart set on this, you know?

423
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,115
Yeah.

424
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,279
- Powder?
- I'm fine.

425
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,509
You sure? Refreshing.

426
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,192
I would imagine it is.

427
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,238
I was just... I'm thinkin' maybe,
you know, if you like...

428
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
then I could maybe take Jake
and Libby for you, you know...

429
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,996
if... if you want.

430
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,958
Look, I know you must be
kind of angry at yourself...

431
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,871
for messing up with the tickets
the other night...

432
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,359
and, uh, I'd like to help you.

433
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,192
I really would, but, um...

434
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,595
Well, the thing is...

435
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,148
I hope to be more and more
a part of Jake's life, you know?

436
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,596
And, uh, frankly, I'm kind
of looking forward to this show.

437
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,035
Give Jake and I, a chance to get
to know each other better.

438
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,429
I mean, uh, you can see
my point, can't you?

439
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,469
Yes, I can.

440
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,033
So, can I ask you a question?

441
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,189
Sure.

442
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,396
You had her once,
why did you ever let her go?

443
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,795
To be honest, Whit...

444
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,757
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'd just
be careful on the stairs here.

445
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,193
Your legs
might be a little rubbery.

446
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,075
I'm fine.

447
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,918
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

448
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,194
I'm fine. I'm...

449
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,271
Yeah, the first step
is often the, uh...

450
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,395
the difficult one.

451
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,798
This is Libby.
Leave me a message.

452
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,916
Hey, Lib, it's me.
Can you give me a ring?

453
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,755
Fuck!

454
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,675
Who the hell are you?

455
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,318
Just open the bloody door.

456
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,549
OK.

457
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,396
- There you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

458
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,311
- Forty-eight.
- Yes.

459
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,435
Hello.

460
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,953
Dennis, I'm really busy.

461
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,075
Can we talk?

462
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,196
No, just buy something or go.

463
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,829
OK. I, can I have one of your
signature cupcakes, please?

464
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,393
Actually,
can I have this big one?

465
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,435
- Dennis.
- That one's fine...

466
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,238
and, uh, I like that one, too.

467
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,312
- Anything else?
- Um, yeah.

468
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,879
What do you see in Whit?

469
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,520
- Uh, forty-nine.
- Yes, I'm forty-nine.

470
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,352
- What can I get for you?
- No, I'm not done yet.

471
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,555
Yes, you are.

472
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,756
Sorry, I think you've used up
your allotted time.

473
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,434
You don't... You don't have
allotted time, OK?

474
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,078
Now you're using up
my allotted time.

475
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,752
You don't get
allotted time, OK?

476
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,034
It's not like a game show,
you know?

477
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,509
You got, like, fifteen seconds
to win a bun.

478
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,272
Goodbye, Dennis.

479
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,315
Yes?

480
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,311
Yes. Hello, yes.

481
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,676
Um, do you have any of those
little gingerbread rabbits?

482
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,034
Oh, no.
We just have those at Easter.

483
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,189
I'm so sorry.

484
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,315
Oh.

485
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,628
Hmm...

486
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,832
Do you have anything else
shaped like an animal?

487
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,875
- Excuse me.
- What?

488
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,871
I haven't paid for my order.

489
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,429
I'm sorry.

490
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,475
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

491
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,959
Excuse me.

492
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,994
- Ow!
- Sorry.

493
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,919
Seriously,
what do you see in him?

494
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,718
OK, he's well-off, all right?

495
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,313
He's kind of... He's quite
good-looking, you know?

496
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,355
But I mean, so what?

497
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,919
Is that what you think
this is about?

498
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,911
I just want
some gorgeous sugar daddy.

499
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,194
I wouldn't say gorgeous.

500
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,474
Well,
that's not why I'm with him.

501
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,675
Well, why are you with him?

502
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,829
You know,
give me one good reason.

503
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,797
One? I could give you fifty.

504
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,030
- I'm fifty!
- Hang on a minute!

505
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,351
He's mature, responsible,
considerate...

506
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,668
he's great with Jake.

507
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,637
- That's only four.
- Hello?

508
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,188
You know what?
He's a good man, Dennis.

509
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,748
You know, he runs marathons
for charity, for Pete's sake.

510
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,273
Oh, big deal!

511
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,112
So you could run a marathon?

512
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,316
Could I have
a chocolate brownie, please?

513
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,719
- Hang on!
- Oh!

514
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,472
Look, Libby, I can change.

515
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,949
Yeah? Well, great.
Let's get married.

516
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,439
- Really?
- No!

517
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,431
We tried that once, remember?

518
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,829
You left me at the altar,
pregnant.

519
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,319
You cock!

520
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,513
Look, Libby, I can change, OK?

521
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,477
I have changed. I can prove it.

522
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,913
How?

523
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,632
I'll tell you.
I will run the marathon.

524
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,753
What?

525
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,795
The one that Whit's doin'...

526
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,711
I'll run that,
and I'll finish it.

527
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,835
Come on,
you've never finished...

528
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,956
anything in your entire life,
Dennis.

529
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,031
Oh, now, you... That's not...

530
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,678
- You know...
- Look, You can't
even finish a sentence.

531
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,715
Don't... don't...

532
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,392
You're just bein',
you know, what's the word?

533
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,435
Cock?

534
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,556
I would settle for something
shaped like a fish.

535
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,595
Well, go to the fishmonger!

536
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,398
I'm a vegetarian.

537
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,516
OK. OK.

538
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,079
Dennis, just please leave.

539
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,355
OK. OK, I'll go.

540
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,793
But I'm gonna
prove this to you, Libby.

541
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,031
I can be mature, considerate,
and responsible.

542
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,029
- Oh!
- Dennis?

543
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,235
Yes, Libby?

544
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,073
It's two pounds, seventy-five.

545
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,639
Oh, yeah, right.

546
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,553
Hey, if Dennis thinks
he can run the race...

547
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,629
he can run the race.

548
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,039
- Thank you.
- There's no way

549
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,633
you can run a marathon.

550
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,188
- Why not?
- 'Cause you is a lazy bastard.

551
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,191
Hey, I'll have you know
I go to spin classes.

552
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,838
You went to one.

553
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,592
Yeah, and now
you walk like John Wayne.

554
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,199
Hey, this is important to me.

555
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,628
I mean it!

556
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,633
Look, I'm sick of
being a nearly man, all right?

557
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,675
I'm sick of being scared.

558
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,034
I'm sick of the regret
I feel every day...

559
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,270
'cause I didn't have the guts
to marry the woman I love!

560
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,831
All that ends
tomorrow at 6 A.M.

561
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,591
# Ow! #

562
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,115
Not bad.

563
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,355
Hi.

564
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,475
Feel better?

565
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,959
Much.

566
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,076
Oh, how was spin class?

567
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,234
Uh, it was...
It was an amazing workout.

568
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,679
Is that right?

569
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,193
Yeah. And I also thought
it would be...

570
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,077
a good chance for me
to get to know Whit...

571
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,752
a little bit better, so...

572
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,876
Well, maybe we should all go out
for dinner then.

573
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,075
- You think?
- Yeah.

574
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,798
And then we could go dancing.

575
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,711
- You're jokin'.
- No, not at all.

576
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,155
And then, afterwards,
we could come back here...

577
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,434
and have a threesome.

578
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,308
Oh. You are joking.

579
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,594
Of course, I am.

580
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,795
Look, Dennis, I don't know
what's going on...

581
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,154
in that head of yours,
but whatever it is...

582
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,798
- I don't like it.
- I've... There's nothing...

583
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,552
- Daddy!
- Hey, buddy.

584
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,629
- You ready for school?
- Yeah.

585
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,711
Wait up, wait up, wait up a sec.

586
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,988
Can I walk with you guys?

587
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,115
OK.

588
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,593
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

589
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,555
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

590
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,429
All right, you ready?

591
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,555
Yeah.

592
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,910
So, Whit, you were, uh, 'round
at Libby's pretty early, eh?

593
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,513
Whit stayed over last night.

594
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,794
- Oh?
- Yes.

595
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,995
They were jumping on the bed.

596
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,275
Wow.

597
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,312
Hey, Jakey, guess what?
Uh, I spoke to my friend...

598
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,356
and he does have an extra ticket
for the show tonight.

599
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,908
What do you say
we, uh, ask Emily to come along?

600
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,399
Yeah!

601
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,311
- Yay.
- What, he told you about Emily?

602
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,435
Oh, yeah.

603
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,635
Oh, and, uh...

604
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,553
Libby tells me that you
decided to run the marathon?

605
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,629
Yeah.

606
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,870
That's great, man. Seriously.

607
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,154
Really, that's awesome.

608
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,309
Thank you.

609
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,355
How did you manage to get in?

610
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,395
What do you mean?

611
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,959
Well, you can't
just show up and run.

612
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,995
Well, why not?

613
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,354
You have to apply in advance.

614
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,315
Well, how far in advance?

615
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,799
Uh, three months.

616
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,835
And when is it again?

617
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,273
Three weeks.

618
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,315
Right.

619
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,628
They'll make exceptions
sometimes...

620
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,950
if you're running for a charity,
but, uh, you know...

621
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,679
each charity is only allowed
a certain amount of runners.

622
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,159
No, you don't have to worry
about me.

623
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,355
I'll get in.

624
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,714
All right.

625
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,836
You ever, uh,
run a marathon before?

626
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,114
No. Why?

627
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,269
It's pretty gruelling.

628
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,635
Well, yeah, that's why
they call it a marathon.

629
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,071
Yeah, actually, technically,
it's called a marathon...

630
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,515
because of the events
of 490 B.C.

631
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,033
There was a Greek soldier...

632
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,075
- named Phei...
- Say, can I just...

633
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,673
- stop you there?
- Yeah.

634
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,511
I've got have nothing to say.
I just wanted to stop you there.

635
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,193
All right, all right.

636
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,470
Hello. Is that
the Cats Protection League?

637
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,315
Hello. I was just...

638
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,628
I'm... I'm running a marathon
next month...

639
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,517
and I was wondering if I could
possibly run on your behalf?

640
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,719
Great. Yeah, yeah.

641
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,916
OK. I see.

642
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,719
How big is the costume?

643
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,797
OK. I'll call you back.

644
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,913
Ooh.

645
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,035
Hi.

646
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,268
- Dennis.
- Oh, yes?

647
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,157
Would you mind not doing that
in front of the customers?

648
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,276
Sorry. I went for a run
this morning in my trunks...

649
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,952
and I think
I've got a bit of a rash...

650
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,678
you know,
down there in the, uh...

651
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,398
- I understand.
- Scrotal zone.

652
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,436
- I understand, Dennis.
- OK.

653
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,080
Please, keep your hands
out of the scrotal zone...

654
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,275
whilst you're at work.

655
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,429
Will do.

656
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,075
Shh.

657
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,355
Dennis!

658
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,835
Sorry. I was, um...

659
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,515
I was in the zone.

660
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,637
So, um, I'd actually
be dressed as a brain.

661
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,870
Um, can I call you back?

662
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,070
# Just 'cause you think it #

663
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,355
# It don't make it so #

664
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,000
# Drive you to drink #

665
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,514
# Won't let you go #

666
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,673
# Plenty of girls
and boys in love #

667
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,715
Come on!

668
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,631
# Plenty of girls #

669
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,997
# And boys in love #

670
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,271
Would you like a cup of tea,
Dennis?

671
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,716
So that's it.

672
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,074
Running this marathon
could be my last chance...

673
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,752
to show Libby that I can change.

674
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,275
Mmm.

675
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,469
You know what I would do
if I were you?

676
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,515
What?

677
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,909
I would get some cream
for that rash.

678
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,631
Let me ask you something,
Dennis.

679
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,554
Why did you leave your lady at
the altar when she was pregnant?

680
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,914
I don't know.
Just wasn't ready.

681
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,511
The toothpaste was already
out of the tube, my friend.

682
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,395
Being ready
had nothing to do with it.

683
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,039
I was scared.

684
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,155
Mmm.

685
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,713
So, you are a coward.

686
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,472
I thought we were just
gonna have a cup of tea.

687
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,396
You did not think
you were good enough.

688
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,833
Am I right?

689
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,956
You thought of your lady,
and you were terrified...

690
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,519
you could not give her
what she needed...

691
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,919
what she deserved.

692
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,392
I thought the same things...

693
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,438
on the day I married
Mrs Ghoshdashtidar.

694
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,155
May she rest.

695
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,233
Did you?

696
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,072
Yes. But guess what?

697
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,118
It turned out
I was good enough.

698
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,872
I made myself good enough.

699
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,192
You did a stupid thing, Dennis.

700
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,838
But she loved you once, and you
must have earned that somehow.

701
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,399
Yeah.

702
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,593
Did you have a good marriage,
Mr Ghoshdashtidar?

703
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,954
Ah.

704
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,514
I remember the feeling
of being complete...

705
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,597
of spending every day
with my best friend...

706
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,033
but most of all...

707
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,796
I remember all the fucking.

708
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,753
Mmm...

709
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,073
Mmm...

710
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,476
Oh, three degrees starboard,
skipper.

711
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,039
Hey, I'm the captain.

712
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,873
Mutiny! Mutiny!

713
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,033
Whoa!

714
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,634
Ahoy there, me lad.

715
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,918
- Oh!
- Hey, Jakey.

716
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,955
Sorry, we're late, love.

717
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,553
Soon as Whit found out
we we're meeting here...

718
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,039
he had to go get his vessel.

719
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,079
Jakey, here.
Flip that switch.

720
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,230
No, not that one. That one.

721
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,718
Whoa! Can I steer it?

722
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,597
No.
But you can watch me steer it.

723
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,595
Mutiny.

724
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,713
Hey. You wanna?

725
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,477
- Was he OK?
- Yeah, he's fine.

726
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,870
We had a really nice time
until Captain Bligh turned up.

727
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,951
Whit just likes to take things
very seriously.

728
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,508
Prepare to be boarded,
or feel the hot wrath...

729
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,114
of Her Majesty's
royal fusillade!

730
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,948
Wait, don't touch that. Wait.

731
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,639
Why won't you
let me steer it?

732
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,438
Uh, because it's mine.

733
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,839
So, you're still gonna run
in this marathon?

734
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,989
Yes, absolutely.

735
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,559
It's gonna be great.

736
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,437
You're gonna see
a whole new Dennis.

737
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,794
Right, well,
I've been thinking about it...

738
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,075
and the thing is, I don't care.

739
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,354
What do you mean?

740
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,476
Dennis, what do you think
you're going to achieve?

741
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,676
Do you honestly think
that running 26 miles...

742
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,239
is just gonna wipe
the slate clean?

743
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,435
Well, you might change your mind
when you see me...

744
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,555
in jogging shorts.

745
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,800
Look, Whit's having
a birthday party...

746
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,835
for me in a couple of weeks...

747
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,559
and it would mean a lot to Jake
if you came.

748
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,675
To Jake?

749
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,475
Hey!

750
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,435
Hey!

751
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,079
Hey!

752
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,115
Hey, OK.

753
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,189
Whose boat is this?

754
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,669
Whose boat... is this?!

755
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,638
Excuse me!
Is... Is this your boat?!

756
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,877
- No way!
- He's toast.

757
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,995
He won't last.

758
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,869
Would you like some pizza,
Dennis?

759
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,837
Oh. Yes, I would actually.
Thank you very much.

760
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,875
- Ow!
- Come here.

761
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,076
What are you doing that...
Stop it.

762
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,035
Are you still gonna do this?

763
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,235
Are you still gonna
run the marathon?

764
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,355
I want to, yes.

765
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,475
Thank God.

766
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,475
Why?

767
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,755
Because I just bet them
every penny I have.

768
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,353
What? You bet on me?

769
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,394
Dennis, you're my best friend.

770
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,232
I'm not gonna bet against you.

771
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,233
Well, thank you.

772
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,673
Not with these odds.

773
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,389
Well, what if I don't finish?

774
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,198
Vincent'll kill you.

775
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,395
Oh, you'll finish.

776
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,799
How can you be so sure?

777
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,031
Get up, get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up, get up!

778
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,197
So, you're gonna be my coach.

779
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,633
That's right.

780
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,675
Why are you here?

781
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,990
I'm the assistant coach.

782
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,069
Why do you get
to be assistant coach?

783
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,718
Because I have this spatula.

784
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,835
Ow!

785
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,395
Go on. Get running.

786
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,630
Wait. Isn't there some sort
of special technique?

787
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,318
Yeah, you put one leg
in front of the other...

788
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,391
over and over again really fast.

789
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,709
Why are you here again?

790
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,279
- Ow!
- Motivation.

791
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,952
# I said, yeah #

792
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,359
# I said, yeah #

793
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,908
- # What they said #
- # What they said #

794
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,399
- # Oh, I said, yeah #
- Lift your knees higher!

795
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,435
- You're not gonna get...
- # Yeah, yeah #

796
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,112
- anywhere like that!
- # It's what they said #

797
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,997
- You've gotta slide more.
- # What they said #

798
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,556
- # Do you believe I would
take something with me #
- Come on, Dennis!

799
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,517
- You want to feel my spatula?!
- # And give it #

800
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,953
- No, I do not!
- # To the police man? #

801
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,634
- Then run! Run like the wind!
- # I wouldn't do that #

802
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,309
- # And if I do that #
- This is harder...

803
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,118
- # I would say, "Sir" #
- for me, you know?

804
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,599
# "Come on
and put the charge on me" #

805
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,159
Ow!

806
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,912
# I wouldn't do that #

807
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,151
- # No, I wouldn't do that #
- Come on, Dennis! Come on!

808
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,800
- Lookin' good! Lookin' good!
- # I'm not a fool
to hurt myself #

809
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,359
- Come on, Dennis.
Keep up the pace.
- # I was innocent #

810
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,556
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
- # Of what they done to me #

811
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,517
# They was wrong #

812
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,555
I think I got a blister.

813
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,629
- # They were wrong #
- OK.

814
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,948
Yeah, gently.

815
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,075
All right.

816
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,793
OK! Oh! All right.

817
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,552
- Is it bad?
- No, it's not that bad.

818
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,153
No. No. It's not.

819
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,470
Ohh! Oh, that's big.

820
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,393
Look at that thing.

821
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,959
It's like a womb.

822
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,669
Don't.

823
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,715
Hey, maybe there's a little man
in there...

824
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,597
who looks just like you,
but he's really good at running.

825
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,113
What are you talking about?!

826
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,349
It's just a thought.

827
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,589
You're gonna have to pop it.

828
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,953
No. No way.

829
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,519
Never pop
another man's pustule.

830
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,113
Well, I'll do it then.
Give me the needle.

831
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,474
That's the closest I could get.

832
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,235
It's fine. I sterilized it.

833
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,355
In what?

834
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,519
It's sterilized.

835
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,478
OK, OK. Here we go.

836
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,669
Ooh, you're gonna get it.

837
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,359
Stick it in.

838
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,589
- Pop it!
- I can't!

839
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,113
- Why not?
- It's scary!

840
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,428
Give it to me.

841
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,475
Just do it slow!

842
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,595
- Do it... Do it gently, OK?
- Yeah.

843
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,159
- Trust me.
- After three, OK?

844
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,355
- OK.
- One.

845
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,835
It's in it!

846
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,072
Get it out!

847
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,639
Bloody take it out!

848
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,073
- Hold still! Hold still!
- Get it!

849
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,875
I'm so sorry.

850
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,033
That's never happened before.

851
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,473
Oh! Oh!

852
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,755
I'm Catholic.

853
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,753
That was the second
most disgusting fluid...

854
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,068
I've ever had in my eye.

855
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,629
Who's that?

856
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,709
That's Mr G.

857
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,472
Get something nice on,
something respectable.

858
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,595
Where we goin'?

859
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,316
Every year,
literally hundreds of people...

860
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,710
are affected by acute
neurocortical emphasitis...

861
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,597
or Hapsburg Syndrome.

862
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,635
I see.

863
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,029
And how does the condition
manifest itself?

864
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,869
The syndrome
is characterized...

865
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,678
by a loss
of lower body function...

866
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,074
sporadic and often violent
outbursts of profanity.

867
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,151
And often chronic flatulence.

868
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,198
It's our aim to raise awareness
of the condition...

869
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,599
and, hopefully,
some funds to give...

870
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,272
some much-needed support...

871
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,316
to people such
as Mr Ghoshdashtidar here.

872
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,628
Mmm...

873
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,593
- Well, we think
that Mr Goshdashti...
- Ghosh!

874
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,557
- Ghoshtashtidar...
- Ghosh! Ghosh!

875
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,110
Ghoshtashtidar's condition
is very, uh, serious...

876
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,715
and warrants support,
and we'd be delighted...

877
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,351
for Mr Doyle to run
on behalf of acute neuro...

878
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,634
Acute neurocortical emphasitis.

879
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,153
- Or, uh...
- Hapsburg Syn...

880
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,674
Syndrome awareness. Yes.

881
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,075
OK.

882
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,793
We'll just need the charity's
registration number.

883
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,515
The what?

884
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,874
The registration number.

885
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,319
Well, that couldn't
have gone any worse.

886
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,038
Mmm.

887
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,269
- Look out!
- Oh!

888
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,588
Ohh!

889
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,193
Aw, hit by a wheelchair.

890
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,955
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

891
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,995
- It stings.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

892
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,035
- It stings.
- No, no, no, no!

893
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,439
Dennis, don't touch him.

894
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,475
- Can you stand?
- Oh, no!

895
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,710
- Are you OK?
- No. My leg's broken.

896
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,869
We are so sorry.

897
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,154
You... Call an ambulance!

898
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,915
Oh, this can't be happening.

899
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,797
I was supposed to be running
the marathon in three weeks.

900
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,949
- Really?
- Yeah.

901
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,439
There were so many people
dependin' on me.

902
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,829
Charity people?

903
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,478
- Hmm?
- Yeah. God!

904
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,516
What charity people?

905
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,828
What do you think?

906
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,835
Nice.

907
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,115
Nicotine patch?

908
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,155
Applied.

909
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,390
- You been to the toilet?
- One and two.

910
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,309
You ready?

911
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,795
Ready.

912
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,115
One.

913
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,595
Ow.

914
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,635
- Two.
- Get up there.

915
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,756
# This is a jailbreak #

916
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,876
# This is a Thursday afternoon #

917
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,110
# But I didn't mean it #

918
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,555
- # I didn't mean it #
- Ow!

919
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,676
# I'd never get that far #

920
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,876
# My baby,
short breath wouldn't do #

921
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,916
# But you took it serious #

922
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,797
- # Took it so serious #
- Raise.

923
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,313
- No!
- No!

924
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,076
One, two...

925
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,832
One more! One more!

926
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,471
# Well, you accused me
of wearing movies in my eyes #

927
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,596
# But I still love you #

928
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,875
# Of course, I love you #

929
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,791
# And so I countered #

930
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,314
# You do the same, my Annie I #

931
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,755
# You closed them so fast #

932
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,311
# And you closed them so tight #

933
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,878
- Hi, Dennis.
- Wha...

934
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,599
I saw your friend Gordon
this morning.

935
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,398
I will replace
anything he stole.

936
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,232
He told me
about his little bet.

937
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,275
Oh, yeah.

938
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,078
- Yeah. Crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

939
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,991
So I made a crazy little bet
of my own.

940
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,832
Ooh. Who with?

941
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,273
With you, silly.

942
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,952
- We haven't made a bet.
- We're about to.

943
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,639
Here it is.

944
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,675
You finish the race...

945
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,035
I'll forgive
all the back rent you owe.

946
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,872
- And if I don't?
- If you don't finish...

947
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,279
you pack your bags
and you leave.

948
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,238
You go, and I finally get
some tidy tenants...

949
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,878
who pay their rent on time.

950
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,076
- Deal?
- No deal.

951
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,037
Hey, what are you...
Hey, give me that.

952
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,155
- Deal?
- Deal.

953
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,437
- Maya, if you think making...
- Maya?

954
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,919
Hey. Hello, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.

955
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,433
How are you?

956
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,636
I've got something for you.

957
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,631
Ooh. It's not the spatula,
is it?

958
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,039
No.

959
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,635
Wow.

960
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,077
To help you be a good man.

961
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,635
I don't...

962
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,715
Thank you.

963
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,515
Wow.

964
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,716
Peter Perfect, a perfect palace.

965
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,836
Try saying that
when you're smashed.

966
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,753
- I will.
- # Lately #

967
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,958
# I been high-steppin' #

968
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,949
# I've got a lover #

969
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,191
- # Who just gets it for real #
- Hey. Hey, Dennis.

970
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,918
- Hey.
- Glad you could make it.

971
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,069
- Thank you.
- Oh, hey.

972
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,957
Wow, Libby.

973
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,439
You look, um... wow.

974
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,475
Thank you.

975
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,073
I know, right?
Never mind all this.

976
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,037
I'll take the view
I have right here.

977
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,269
Oh.

978
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,876
I'm Gordon, Libby's cousin.
Hello.

979
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,678
Gordon. Of course.
I've heard a lot about you.

980
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,159
Very nice to meet you.

981
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,753
- Really?
- Yeah.

982
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,558
Oh. I thought you said
he was an asshole.

983
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,435
- Dennis!
- Gordon.

984
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,033
- What?
- It's OK, Lib.

985
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,559
Libby, I got you
a birthday present.

986
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,914
Oh.

987
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,319
It's a CD.

988
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,992
I hope you don't have it,
'cause I don't have a receipt...

989
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,957
and I didn't exactly
get it in a shop.

990
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,712
Well, thank you, I think.

991
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,839
It's OK. Where's the toilet?

992
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,591
I'll show you, and, uh,
you can entertain Dennis.

993
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,635
OK.

994
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,029
That is if he doesn't mind
hangin' out with an asshole.

995
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,237
He was joking. I never
said you were an asshole.

996
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,276
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, I did.

997
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,355
Whit seems nice.

998
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,429
Yeah, he is.

999
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,988
Good-looking, friendly,
well-off, steady job...

1000
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,035
good with Jake...

1001
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,633
just like you got him
out of a catalogue.

1002
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,835
And what's your point?

1003
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,275
I ordered a pair of shoes
once from a catalogue.

1004
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,351
Gorgeous soft leather
Italian loafers.

1005
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,589
They looked amazing,
but then they arrived...

1006
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,716
and I put them on,
and they hurt like fuck.

1007
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,028
Thanks. I'll bear that in mind.

1008
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,279
Wow.

1009
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,271
Hey, do you think it would
be weird if I took a bath?

1010
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,078
Yeah, that would be weird.

1011
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,678
- Hey.
- Hey.

1012
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,193
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

1013
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,508
Cheers.

1014
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,635
Cheers.

1015
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,233
What do you think?

1016
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,311
I think I see a guy
peeing on your car.

1017
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,435
- What?
- Got you.

1018
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,511
Oh, very good.

1019
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,511
Actually, you see that?

1020
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,555
What?

1021
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,278
There. I'm talking
about St. Paul's Cathedral.

1022
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,634
- You see it?
- Uh-huh.

1023
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,278
Currently my favourite spot
in London.

1024
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,475
You know why?

1025
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,596
Uh, is it because that's
where you first realized...

1026
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,829
how amazing you are?

1027
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,113
It's the finish line
for the marathon.

1028
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,229
Only two more days,
and I get to cross it.

1029
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,275
Can't wait.

1030
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,839
Me, too.

1031
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,956
Greatest feeling in the world,
finishing a distance race.

1032
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,190
I think you're really
gonna get a kick out of it.

1033
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,474
You don't think
I'm gonna finish, do you?

1034
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,549
No, I don't.

1035
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,595
Why not?

1036
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,398
'Cause it's really hard, Dennis.

1037
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,754
Actually requires
a couple of things...

1038
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,638
that, uh, forgive me,
but you don't seem to possess.

1039
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,948
I happen to have
a very nice pair...

1040
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,598
of running shoes now,
thank you very much.

1041
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,753
I'm talking about discipline
and perseverance.

1042
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,956
And all cute
little comments aside...

1043
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,954
there comes a point
in every race...

1044
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,758
it could be the fifth mile,
it could be the 25th...

1045
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,273
but, eventually,
you're gonna hit...

1046
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,157
what runners like to call
"the wall."

1047
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,514
And when you do...

1048
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,194
you won't be able to breathe
or think or even move.

1049
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,316
All you're gonna wanna do
is give up.

1050
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,833
And I have
a very strong feeling...

1051
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,036
that that's exactly
what you're gonna do, Dennis.

1052
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,675
See, that's the difference...

1053
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,035
between getting a girl
like Libby...

1054
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,519
and keeping a girl like Libby.

1055
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,155
You good?
You need anything else?

1056
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,231
- No, I'm good.
- OK.

1057
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,273
# Love is sweet, they say #

1058
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,910
# Promises of tomorrow #

1059
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:29,718
# But the tighter you grip,
the faster you slip #

1060
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,395
# This much I know #

1061
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,758
# Lately, I want everything #

1062
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,513
# Every star tied to a string #

1063
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,433
# Coffee, tea, and in between #

1064
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,353
# The sweetest smile
I've ever seen #

1065
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,830
# A different song
in every room... #

1066
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,036
- Oh, shit! Sorry. Sorry.
- That's OK.

1067
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,872
- No, it's OK. It's OK.
- Oh, man. It's just...

1068
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,473
It's just soda water, honestly.

1069
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,754
Should I not rub
your boob, then?

1070
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,239
- Yeah.
- OK. Sorry.

1071
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,355
I can do the other one,
you know?

1072
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,396
'Cause I'm here, I might as well
just even it out.

1073
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,515
Sorry.

1074
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,633
So, you havin' a...
havin' a good time?

1075
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,829
Yeah. Yes, I am, thank you.

1076
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,395
You've lost weight.

1077
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,708
Yeah, just a little bit.

1078
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,755
Yeah.

1079
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,239
You know, get on.

1080
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,278
Where's Jake?
I thought he was gonna be here.

1081
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,588
Uh, no.

1082
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,159
Whit thought that we'd have
a better time...

1083
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,071
if we got a sitter.

1084
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,435
Oh. What did you think?

1085
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,239
I should get back.

1086
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,073
Libby, um,
I never actually thanked you.

1087
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,675
For what?

1088
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,196
Well, for just sort of
lettin' me back into your life.

1089
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,872
Jake's life.

1090
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,279
Yeah, well, you know.

1091
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,789
I mean, I-I wouldn't have
been surprised...

1092
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,677
if you just cut me off
completely, you know?

1093
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,079
Ugh, now you tell me.

1094
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,839
Well, no, I mean...

1095
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,114
No, he needs his dad.

1096
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,435
Yeah.

1097
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,074
You were right, you know,
about me enterin' the marathon.

1098
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,230
It... You know,
it was because I was...

1099
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,151
sort of trying to win you back
kind of thing.

1100
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,595
And I'd always kinda hoped
that maybe, we'd, you know...

1101
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,795
get back together and that...

1102
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,474
but, you know,
when I saw you with Whit...

1103
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,639
- Dennis.
- I know... I know... I know...

1104
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,678
I know it's the height
of hypocrisy, and I know...

1105
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,159
I know doin' this
isn't gonna change anything...

1106
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,549
or... or make anything better,
but, um...

1107
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,911
I'd just...
I'd settle for your respect.

1108
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,509
You know,
I'd settle for you smiling...

1109
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,955
when you thought about the time
that we had together...

1110
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,076
and not thinkin'
it was a waste of time.

1111
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,229
You know, I mean, I know...

1112
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,437
I didn't do you any favours
on that day, OK?

1113
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,239
I did a stupid, stupid thing.

1114
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,198
But it was
only because I thought...

1115
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,874
spoiling your day was better
than ruining your life.

1116
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,598
Does that make any sense?

1117
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,554
You're such an idiot.

1118
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,074
Hey, I got you something.

1119
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,752
Oh, what is it?

1120
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,876
It's something
I think you don't have.

1121
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,598
A history
of reliable boyfriends?

1122
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,350
No, it's...
Well, it's only, you know...

1123
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,509
- Open it later on.
- OK.

1124
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,158
Happy birthday.

1125
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,593
- Thank you.
- No.

1126
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,995
Oh.

1127
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,476
- Everyone, could I have
your attention?
- Oh, my God.

1128
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,269
Hey. Everyone,
your attention, please.

1129
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,430
Everyone, hi.

1130
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,475
Thank you for coming.

1131
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,039
- Really good to see you all.
- Thank you.

1132
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,429
As you all know,
we're here to celebrate...

1133
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,115
the birthday
of one Elizabeth Olivia O'Dell.

1134
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,276
Happy birthday.

1135
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,750
As many of you know, uh,
my passion in life is running.

1136
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,994
In fact,
in a couple of days...

1137
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,469
I'll be completing another
marathon, thank you very much.

1138
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,517
Uh, now, success in running
requires a lot...

1139
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,114
of the same things
as success in love...

1140
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,589
passion, determination...

1141
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,319
and something I've needed
a lot of with Libby, stamina.

1142
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,313
That's just inappropriate,
isn't it?

1143
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,674
The long-winded point
I'm trying to make...

1144
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,275
is that both love and running
require heart...

1145
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,396
and Libby has...
truly, has more heart...

1146
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,311
than any other person
I've ever known.

1147
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,960
So happy birthday, sweetie.

1148
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,114
Thank you all.

1149
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,712
Oh, trainers!

1150
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,114
I'm sorry. Can I, uh,
just see this for a second?

1151
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,760
Now, what, um...
As most of you know...

1152
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,832
I usually run my races alone,
but I thought...

1153
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,709
I was wondering
if you would consider...

1154
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,074
becoming my partner?

1155
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,195
Oh, my.

1156
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,358
Libby, will you marry me?

1157
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,472
No, no, no, no.

1158
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,028
OK. Yes.

1159
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,633
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1160
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,594
So beautiful.

1161
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,999
Just beautiful.

1162
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,795
Thank you.

1163
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,275
Thank you, everybody.

1164
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,835
Crazy.

1165
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,875
What'd I miss?

1166
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,355
So...

1167
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,555
You bloody... poison.

1168
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,231
All right. You can stick it
up your ass...

1169
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,914
you big American prick.

1170
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,070
# Our love has changed #

1171
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,633
- I don't mind they've decided.
- # It's not the same #

1172
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,833
# And the only way to say it #

1173
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,472
# Is say it #

1174
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,439
# It's better #

1175
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,477
# I can't concede #

1176
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,874
# This way I feel #

1177
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,794
# For all the time
we spend together #

1178
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,351
# Forever just gets better #

1179
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,997
# See, what I'm trying
to say is #

1180
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,877
# You make things better #

1181
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,995
# And no matter
what the day is #

1182
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,631
# With you here, it's better #

1183
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,150
# I'll stand by you #

1184
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,554
# If you stand by me #

1185
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,916
# I think it's time
that I reveal it #

1186
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,116
# 'Cause I believe it #

1187
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,516
# It's better #

1188
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,916
# See, what I'm tryin'
to say is #

1189
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,790
# You make things better #

1190
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,388
Dennis!

1191
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,632
So what do you think
we should do, Dennis?

1192
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,918
Jake got really upset when
I tried to explain it to him.

1193
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,232
So, I just wonder whether maybe
you could talk to him today?

1194
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,388
You know, just...
If he heard it from you...

1195
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,040
that you're always gonna be
his daddy, you know?

1196
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,838
I take it the diet's off.

1197
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,117
Dennis, are you even listening?

1198
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,189
Dennis!

1199
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,793
What? You want...
You want me to tell Jake...

1200
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,030
what a... what a...
what a perfect guy Whit is...

1201
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,394
and it's all gonna be
really perfect...

1202
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,959
in his new perfect life?

1203
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,315
No.
Not necessarily in those words.

1204
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,789
I cannot believe
you're gonna marry this guy.

1205
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,950
He pulled your engagement ring
out of a shoe.

1206
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,837
Please, Dennis,
you're the only one...

1207
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,956
who can help Jake
feel OK about this.

1208
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,156
Listen, if you wanna marry Whit,
that's fine, OK?

1209
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,151
You're a big girl, and you can
make your own mistakes, OK?

1210
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,719
But don't come down here
while I'm eating...

1211
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,756
my full English breakfast
with extra breakfast...

1212
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,512
and expect me to make things
easier for you, OK?

1213
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,352
Can I please get
some ketchup here?!

1214
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,674
I'm not gonna run.

1215
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,715
What?!

1216
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,233
I said I'm not running.

1217
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,679
What do you mean,
you're not running?

1218
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,830
I mean, I'm not running. I'm
not running a stupid marathon.

1219
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,079
Why? Because Libby's
getting married again?

1220
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,115
What did you think?

1221
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,599
She... She's not gonna find
anybody better than you?

1222
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,715
Well, let me be the first
to tell you.

1223
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,313
You know, you're
not a tough act to follow.

1224
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,879
Oh, what?
You think I don't know that?

1225
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,951
I don't care any more!

1226
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,198
- What about me?
- What about you?

1227
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,998
I've got money on this!
A lot of money!

1228
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,638
That is not my problem!

1229
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,835
Quit it!

1230
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,069
I'm not the quitter.

1231
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,033
- Let me go!
- Ow, my ear!

1232
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,394
- Let go!
- Ow!

1233
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,715
Oh, OK! Oh, all right!

1234
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,190
Oh, enough!
Just... Just stop for a minute!

1235
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,677
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

1236
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,354
# I've got to get this feeling
off my chest #

1237
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,715
# The doctor says
all I need's pills and rest #

1238
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,151
# Since every day,
I love you less and less #

1239
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,832
# Unless, unless #

1240
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,114
- # I know, I feel it #
- Are you gonna run?

1241
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,155
# In my bones #
- No!

1242
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,434
# I'm sick, I'm tired #

1243
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,669
# Of staying in control #

1244
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,911
- # Oh, yes, I feel
I race upon a wheel #
- Oh, God!

1245
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,514
- OK, OK, OK, OK.
- You'll run?

1246
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,113
# Oh, yes, I'm stressed #

1247
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,519
# I'm sorry I digressed #

1248
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,239
# lmpressed,
you're dressed to SOS #

1249
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,197
# Oh-oh #

1250
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,794
- My balls!
- # And my parents love me #

1251
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,917
# Oh-oh #

1252
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,673
- # And my girlfriend loves me #
- That's it! Run away!

1253
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,273
That's what you always do!

1254
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,639
Run away!

1255
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,197
# Every day,
I love you less and less #

1256
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,873
Hey, what the...

1257
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,318
- Hello, Dennis.
- What are you doing?

1258
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,355
Gordon called.

1259
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,396
He tells me
you're not running the marathon.

1260
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,879
- Yeah, but...
- But, what?

1261
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,234
Are you running or not?

1262
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,275
- No, but...
- So there you go.

1263
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,509
- Wait...
- Sorry, Dennis.

1264
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,158
A bet's a bet. You're out.

1265
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,189
Mr Ghoshdashtidar?
Mr Ghoshdashtidar!

1266
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,599
- Who the hell are you?
- Oh, please, look.

1267
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,069
- I thought you were
a good man, Dennis.
- Yeah...

1268
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,311
A little screwed up here
in the head, OK.

1269
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,356
But Maya was right about you.
You are no good.

1270
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,873
- Look...
- Always running away...

1271
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,393
never running
in the right direction.

1272
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,435
Yeah, but, oh...

1273
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,034
I bought you
new running shoes, Dennis.

1274
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,554
The man said
they were the best you can buy.

1275
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,392
- Yes, but...
- "But, but, but!"

1276
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,472
Always "but"!
Always excuses with you!

1277
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,233
Always some reason
why it's not your fault!

1278
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,756
I have news for you,
Dennis Doyle from downstairs.

1279
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,351
It's all your fault!

1280
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,308
- Hi.
- Hi.

1281
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,472
You... You havin' a yard sale?

1282
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,316
No. Where's Libby?

1283
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,833
Uh, she's pickin' up Jake.

1284
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,356
I suppose, uh,
congratulations are in order.

1285
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,113
Oh, yeah. Well, thank you.

1286
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,755
Best man won.

1287
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,598
Well, I wasn't really aware
it was a contest.

1288
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,715
Dennis! Dennis!
Is Jake with you?

1289
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,755
No, why? L...

1290
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,068
Well, is he here, Whit?

1291
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,309
- I thought you were
picking him up.
- Jake!

1292
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,355
- Libby?
- Jake!

1293
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,509
Libby, what is...

1294
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,953
- What did you say to him?!
- L... What are you...

1295
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,189
I didn't say anything.
What do you mean?

1296
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,429
Well, he was at Emily's
and something happened.

1297
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,555
He just ran out.

1298
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,790
- What?
- He has run away, OK?

1299
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,233
Jake ran away!

1300
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,835
Jake!

1301
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,355
Jake!

1302
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,755
Gordon!

1303
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,395
Gordon!

1304
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,238
- Yes?
- Jake's run away.

1305
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,151
- What?
- He's run away!

1306
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,195
All right.
Well, wait a minute.

1307
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,032
Just calm down.
Think for a second.

1308
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,269
Where would he go?

1309
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,113
Hiya, snot-face.

1310
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,154
Yeah, he's fine.

1311
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,355
We'll be back in about
a half an hour, I guess.

1312
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,634
OK.

1313
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,188
Is she mad at me?

1314
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,998
No, no.
She's just glad you're OK.

1315
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,358
Do you wanna tell me
what happened?

1316
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,238
Emily doesn't wanna be
my girlfriend any more.

1317
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,435
Why not?

1318
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,670
'Cause there's this other boy,
Robert...

1319
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,318
and he's got a ponytail...

1320
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,391
and she likes him now.

1321
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,311
What, she likes him
because he's got a ponytail?

1322
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,958
Uh-huh.

1323
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,274
Jake 'n Bake...

1324
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,588
as you get older,
you're gonna realize...

1325
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,875
there are a lot of things
that you don't like, OK?

1326
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,190
Things much worse than this.

1327
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,475
And when those things happen,
you can't just run away.

1328
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,391
Why not?

1329
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,710
Because it doesn't solve
the problem.

1330
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,789
You know,
when you start running...

1331
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,835
the problem's still there.

1332
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,434
You've got to stick at it,
and then figure out a way...

1333
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,432
to solve the problem, even if
it's really, really hard.

1334
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,397
Is that what you do, Dad?

1335
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,194
Dad?

1336
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,835
Dennis!

1337
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,114
Dennis!

1338
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,235
Gordon!

1339
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,995
Gordon!

1340
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,672
- Found him?
- Yes.

1341
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,512
Good. You can't stay here.

1342
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,235
Gordon!

1343
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,275
What?!

1344
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,112
I'm running.

1345
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,879
Well, come on up then.

1346
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,076
Wow, these are great.
Where'd you get 'em?

1347
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,559
- Whit's place.
- Thanks.

1348
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,709
See, the trick is...

1349
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,075
you got to load up on carbs
the night before the race.

1350
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,115
I read it in Cosmo.

1351
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,189
How are the legs? Not too tight?

1352
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,713
No. No, they're fine.

1353
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,915
Have you got everything
you need?

1354
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,309
You know, your shoes,
your shorts, penis t-shirt?

1355
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,152
- Yes.
- Oh.

1356
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,159
I'm not really in the mood.

1357
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,719
- It's for your nipples.
- What?

1358
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,189
You run a 26-mile race,
a lot of friction...

1359
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,599
is generated from your shirt
to your nipples.

1360
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,908
And the last thing you want
during a marathon...

1361
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:15,955
is nipple chafing.

1362
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,234
- Cosmo?
- Yeah.

1363
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,514
I'm not puttin' that
on my nipples, OK?

1364
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,477
And I'm not gonna eat this.
Let's just go to sleep.

1365
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,118
Well, at least,
let me make your bed for you.

1366
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,275
Anything else?

1367
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,429
Have you got a pillow?

1368
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,670
- No.
- Well, then I guess I'm fine.

1369
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,071
Hey, what time
do you have to be up tomorrow?

1370
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,118
Well, we should set the alarm
for about seven o'clock.

1371
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,792
- I don't have an alarm clock.
- Why not?

1372
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,711
I never need to be anywhere.

1373
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,399
The race starts at 9.00, OK?

1374
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,438
So we should leave here
no later than 8.00, OK?

1375
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,714
OK.

1376
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,955
Night.

1377
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,075
Love you.

1378
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,675
A very good morning to you.

1379
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,557
It's a beautiful day
here in London...

1380
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,551
for the first
annual Nike River Run.

1381
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,835
We've had a very warm welcome
from the crowd...

1382
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,558
and we've got perfect conditions
for this race, Denise.

1383
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,039
We certainly have.

1384
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,270
26.2 miles
along the River Thames...

1385
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,396
10,000 runners
from all over the globe...

1386
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,311
and an amazing way
for many of these folks...

1387
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,914
to raise money for so many
worthwhile charities.

1388
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,228
And as we can see,
race officials...

1389
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,197
are already busy
at the starting line...

1390
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,748
with the start
less than an hour away.

1391
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,512
- Taxi!
- # Keep on runnin' #

1392
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,919
Taxi!

1393
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,753
- # Keep on hidin' #
- Taxi!

1394
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:41,795
Wait!

1395
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,835
- Wait!
- # One fine day #

1396
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,114
# I'm gonna be the one #

1397
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,872
# To make you understand #

1398
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,188
- It's a wonderful course.
- # Oh, yeah #

1399
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,555
- They'll wind
around the Thames...
- # I'm gonna be your man #

1400
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,039
They'll cross over five bridges,
including Osney Bridge...

1401
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,519
Albert Bridge,
and the Millennium Bridge.

1402
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,397
OK, OK. So go at your
own pace today, all right?

1403
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,357
- Slow and steady.
- OK. Slow and steady.

1404
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,592
Yeah, they're challenging
the leaders we have here.

1405
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,148
One from Japan,
Hiyusha Shinuzu...

1406
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,708
and, of course, up there also,
is Sumi Yamata.

1407
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,155
Watch it!

1408
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,632
- Idiot!
- # Keep on runnin' #

1409
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,355
- # Runnin' from #
- The other way! Go back!

1410
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,873
- # My heart #
- No, we're not goin' back!

1411
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,712
Amongst the names
we should keep an eye on...

1412
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,869
are the men from Kenya.

1413
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,316
Always so strong, Wilson Deetay
and Collington Degwa...

1414
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,153
they always can be found
at front of the pack.

1415
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:29,995
This is as far
as I can get, mate.

1416
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,433
But I need to get to the start
of the race.

1417
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,954
Well, it's just over the bridge.
That's fifteen quid, mate.

1418
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,109
Have you got any money?

1419
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,918
Sir, we have
a slight liquidity problem.

1420
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,831
That is a shame.

1421
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,035
Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1422
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,031
Look, look. This is a 19...

1423
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,430
...40 Rolex 520 Perpetual
Oyster with a bubble back.

1424
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,475
That's not too shabby.

1425
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,515
Gordon,
you can't possibly give him...

1426
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,715
Hey, it's an investment.

1427
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,234
Gordon, thank you.

1428
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,435
I'll see you later then.

1429
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,073
# Keep on runnin' #

1430
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,388
Hey, good luck!

1431
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,232
Now, typically,
the day would have started...

1432
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,390
at the crack of dawn
for most of these runners.

1433
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,754
They had a balanced breakfast...

1434
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,071
precise physical
and mental preparation.

1435
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,232
On a day like today,
to leave anything to chance...

1436
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,231
you'd either have
to be extremely naive...

1437
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,639
or a complete idiot.

1438
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,029
# Everyone is talkin' about me #

1439
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,793
Over here. To me, to me.

1440
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,269
That's it. Be careful.

1441
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,429
That's an antique.

1442
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,191
- Did it start? Did it start?
- Not yet.

1443
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,429
- Turn it on.
- Here we go.

1444
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,794
What do we love
about these days...

1445
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,030
is the sheer
mix of competitors.

1446
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,712
They come
in all shapes and sizes...

1447
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,952
from the elite over there
to the... how should we put it...

1448
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,519
not so elite.

1449
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,874
That's Dennis!

1450
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,592
Look at that stretch.
Look at that.

1451
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,269
Double or nothing?

1452
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,315
Yeah, right.

1453
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,915
Just a few minutes to go now.
The warm-ups should be complete.

1454
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,231
It's time, if you have one,
for that pre-race ritual.

1455
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,275
Well, well, well.
You made it, huh?

1456
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,315
Yeah.

1457
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,913
Just wanna wish you luck
out there.

1458
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,560
You, too. How are your nipples?

1459
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,035
Great.

1460
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,875
- More toast.
- Only a few moments...

1461
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,154
to go now,
and the officials are...

1462
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,196
Who do you want to win,
Daddy or Whit?

1463
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,113
- Who do you wanna win?
- Daddy, of course.

1464
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,792
- If you're one
of the fun runners...
- What about you?

1465
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,110
- It's just about
completing the course.
- Eat your toast.

1466
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,236
And what a great turnout
we've got here today.

1467
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,594
Why am I always the tortoise?

1468
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,635
A bet's a bet.

1469
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,675
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1470
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,113
- Pardon me.
- All right.

1471
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,473
Well, Dennis, I gotta admit...

1472
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,913
I didn't think
you'd make it this far.

1473
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,794
I mean, uh...

1474
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,030
you don't exactly have
the best, uh, track record...

1475
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,109
now, do you?

1476
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,077
Yeah, well that was then,
and this is now.

1477
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,195
No, Dennis.

1478
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,435
This is now.

1479
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,475
All right.

1480
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,159
Don't feel you have to keep up
with me.

1481
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,753
Well, don't feel
you have to keep up with me.

1482
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,637
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

1483
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,073
And they're off, Chris.

1484
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,752
Yet another great marathon...

1485
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,558
getting under way
here in London.

1486
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,991
And having these great runners
go 26.2 miles...

1487
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,275
of crowded London streets...

1488
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,032
That was great, what you did
with Jake yesterday, by the way.

1489
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,075
Thanks.

1490
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,718
I know Libby
really appreciated it, too.

1491
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,755
Oh, I'm glad.

1492
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,829
In fact,
she was so appreciative...

1493
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,592
we had a nice little jump
on the bed.

1494
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,113
- What?
- Have a good race.

1495
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,635
Isn't it enough?

1496
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,675
What?

1497
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,149
You got the girl, all right?
Isn't it enough?

1498
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,514
I just think it's high time
you realize...

1499
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,113
that it's over, sir.

1500
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,599
Otherwise, it's gonna be
very tough for you...

1501
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,875
- when we move to Chicago.
- What?

1502
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,393
You better
slow down there, chief.

1503
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,708
You got a long way to go.

1504
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,156
- Yeah, well, so have you.
- Oh, yeah!

1505
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,355
Yes, I like it.

1506
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,271
Run, fat boy, run!

1507
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,113
I can lose weight...

1508
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,031
but you'll always be
an asshole.

1509
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:26,995
Now, once again,
it's still being dominated...

1510
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,274
- by the Kenyans, Denise.
- Look at that.

1511
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,749
The runners are making their way
along the embankment.

1512
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,068
What a beautiful view of the...

1513
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,238
So, here we are
among the leaders of the moment.

1514
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,914
The pace is relatively relaxed
for the opening miles.

1515
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:45,989
Maybe a little too relaxed,
Chris.

1516
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,672
It looks like we've got
a couple of amateurs...

1517
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,795
coming up from the back.

1518
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:53,875
Mom!

1519
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,518
It looks like these two boys...

1520
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,431
are running a race
of their own here today.

1521
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,669
In fact,
they're causing quite a stir...

1522
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,829
among the serious runners.

1523
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,512
Not something
you'd really expect...

1524
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,919
at this stage in the race.

1525
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,149
Oh. Sorry, sir.

1526
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:05,875
There's a man down.

1527
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,715
Sorry.

1528
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,440
All eyes right now
are on these two runners.

1529
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,272
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

1530
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,635
- We hope to bring you
that information quickly.
- Slow down.

1531
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,155
But he looks good, doesn't he?

1532
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,389
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1533
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,596
...setting a new world record.

1534
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,395
What are you trying to prove?

1535
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,993
She doesn't
love you any more, man.

1536
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,229
I'm not doing this for Libby.

1537
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,309
Yeah, right.

1538
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,389
You're ridiculous, dude.

1539
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,789
What's the matter, Whit,
can't keep up?

1540
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,755
Oh!

1541
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,555
Daddy!

1542
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,437
Dennis! I mean, Whit!

1543
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,234
It does look very serious.

1544
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,355
We're getting
some more information...

1545
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,311
Stay down! Stay down!

1546
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,079
Where do you think you're going?

1547
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,754
- I have to go help Dennis.
- Why?

1548
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,831
Because I am
the assistant coach.

1549
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,515
Yes!

1550
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,875
He now leads
at the ten-mile mark.

1551
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,035
And that looks really painful.

1552
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,439
Looks like
this runner's race day...

1553
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,431
will be ending
at a Leeds hospital.

1554
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,794
Yeah, absolutely tragic...

1555
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,359
Mom, do something!

1556
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,873
- We certainly do.
Let's get back...
- Come on.

1557
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,279
To the leaders
in the female race.

1558
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,315
Shit.

1559
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,718
Huh?

1560
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,920
Gordon, I think I speak
for everyone here...

1561
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,355
when I say, "Give me my money."

1562
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,158
Five grand, please.

1563
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,471
OK, here's the thing
about the money...

1564
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,595
and, actually,
it's kind of funny.

1565
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,552
Uh... I don't have it.

1566
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,148
Would you excuse us a moment?

1567
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,196
Hi. I'm looking
for a patient, Dennis Doyle.

1568
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,599
Are you family?

1569
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,193
- Yeah.
- Doyle?

1570
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,713
Yes, Dennis Doyle.

1571
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,429
Oh, I'm sorry,
we don't seem to have anyone...

1572
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,033
registered by that name.

1573
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,680
Are you sure?
He's a runner in the marathon.

1574
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,079
Oh, the runner. Oh, yeah.

1575
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,037
Well, he's just arrived.

1576
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,678
- Libby?
- Whit?

1577
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,954
How'd you know I was here?

1578
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,359
What are you doing here?

1579
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,510
Honey,
that psychopath tripped me.

1580
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,034
He tripped me.
I think I have ligament damage.

1581
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,633
Guys, can we... Can we just...

1582
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,950
Fellas, can we...
Look, I'm a patient, please.

1583
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,553
Just one... Find me!

1584
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,119
Easy, easy! Ow!

1585
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,077
Vince, look, when I said
I didn't have the money...

1586
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,115
I meant
I didn't have the money here.

1587
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,191
- I can pay.
- Oh, you're gonna pay.

1588
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,312
No, wait. Look... Vincent.

1589
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,913
Wait... Wait... What?

1590
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,194
Wait. Wait a tick.

1591
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,510
Not so bloody fast, mate.

1592
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,828
Who the hell are you?

1593
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,478
Thanks a lot, Mr G!

1594
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,232
Your friend is a man of honour.

1595
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,275
What, Vincent?

1596
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,035
Yes, he said he's going to kick
shit out of you later instead.

1597
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,075
I don't understand.

1598
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,958
On the TV, they said
he was being brought here.

1599
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,393
One second.

1600
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,833
I could sue him.
You know that, right?

1601
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,114
I could sue him
for everything he has...

1602
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,111
but, you know, seriously,
what am I gonna do...

1603
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,272
with some pizza boxes
and a Judas Priest t-shirt?

1604
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,952
Honey,
I'm sure it was an accident.

1605
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,598
Well, you weren't there, OK?

1606
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,636
You didn't see it.
He was wild-eyed, all right?

1607
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,870
He was frothing at the mouth
at one point.

1608
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,713
It was like running a marathon
with Cujo, OK?

1609
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,917
Jake, buddy,
can I control the bed, please?

1610
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,831
No, but you can watch me
control it.

1611
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,753
Libby? Where are you?

1612
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,068
- The hospital.
- Are you with him?

1613
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,115
No, he's not here.

1614
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,189
Well, what do you mean
he's not there?

1615
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,633
I mean, he's not here.

1616
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,713
Well,
where the hell is he then?

1617
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,360
All right.
It's still... It's on.

1618
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,555
The race is still on.

1619
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,960
I can't believe
you let Gordon go, Vincent.

1620
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,155
- Yeah, but he said
he was gonna pay us...
- Back to the story.

1621
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,071
- Right, Vincent?
- The first images
are coming in...

1622
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,912
- from what looks
like a camera phone...
- Vincent?

1623
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,389
- Vincent?
- Showing a lone,
mysterious runner.

1624
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,711
Uh, he's looking very badly
injured, I must say...

1625
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,711
and he's also causing
some major traffic...

1626
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,668
- Cab.
- Yeah, it's a Rolex.

1627
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,796
I'm not gonna sell it.
It's a family heirloom now.

1628
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,835
What!

1629
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,071
Wait! What are you doing?!

1630
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,674
- Step on it!
- You can't
just take a man's cab!

1631
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,475
All right!

1632
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,675
Hello, there...

1633
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,557
Dennis Doyle from downstairs!

1634
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,868
Who the hell are you?

1635
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,593
You beauty, come on!

1636
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,552
And as the sun
sets over London...

1637
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,198
we're still looking
into the identity...

1638
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,953
of that mysterious runner.

1639
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,429
Come on, Dennis,
you can do it! Come on!

1640
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,238
The only concrete thing
we do know...

1641
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,756
is that he's running
for erectile dysfunction.

1642
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,431
Good news, Mr Bloom.

1643
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,715
No rupture, no ligament damage.

1644
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,358
Oh, that's great.

1645
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,429
Jake, please?

1646
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,193
In fact,
there's no real damage anywhere.

1647
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,069
Are you sure, doctor?

1648
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,639
Jake, please.

1649
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,790
It's, uh, like, uh...

1650
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,835
What is it you runners say?

1651
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,353
You hit the wall.

1652
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,798
No, no, that...
That's not possi...

1653
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,828
God damn it, will you stop...

1654
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,911
messin' around with the bed,
you little shit?!

1655
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,509
God.

1656
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,955
Good evening.
It's time for a sports update.

1657
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,758
Top story, the Nike River Run.

1658
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,637
We'll be chatting to the winner
a little bit later on...

1659
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,075
but first, we've had thousands
of e-mails and calls...

1660
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,718
about our mystery runner.

1661
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,438
Well, I can tell you now,
our TV crew...

1662
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,555
has just caught up with him.

1663
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,595
Excuse me. Sorry.

1664
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,829
Will you slow down, please?

1665
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,278
You hungry?
You wanna get a bite?

1666
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,112
Stop! Stop!

1667
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,428
Everyone out. Get out.

1668
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,675
- Come on!
- I'm goin'!

1669
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,875
Hey!

1670
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,109
Just go away!

1671
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,109
- Somebody trip him.
- Go away!

1672
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,428
Knock him over.

1673
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,272
No, invalid. Off-side.

1674
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,832
- Oh!
- Leave him alone! Get off him!

1675
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,592
I want my money now!

1676
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,193
Don't listen to them, Dennis!

1677
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,269
You are a winner!

1678
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,395
I want my money now!

1679
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,835
Stop it! I'm wearing helmet!

1680
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:34,875
Clear off!

1681
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,155
"The loneliness
of the long-distance runner"...

1682
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:40,391
a phrase epitomized by this man,
Dennis Doyle.

1683
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,118
For the last eleven miles,
he's been running...

1684
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,272
on what appears to be
a severely sprained ankle.

1685
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,432
What a testament to the power
of the human spirit.

1686
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,953
Mr Doyle, how do you feel?

1687
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,359
How the fuck
do you think I feel?

1688
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,714
What an inspiration.

1689
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,394
We'll keep you updated
as this story progresses.

1690
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,311
- Get out of the bloody way!
- Sorry.

1691
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,436
- Well, what a remarkable day...
- Libby. Libby, I'm sorry...

1692
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,192
- we've had at
the marathon on the Thames...
- all right? I lost it. L...

1693
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,872
- with an event
dominated as ever...
- I wasn't thinking.

1694
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,632
- By the crowds
and the fun runners...
- I'm sorry.

1695
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,199
- Honey, can we just...
- but particularly by

1696
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,235
- Jake, buddy...
- one man.

1697
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,275
Would you mind just giving us...

1698
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,793
a little peace with the TV,
please?

1699
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,235
- Thank you.
- Go on, Dennis!

1700
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,275
The whole of London...

1701
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,555
Honey, can we
just talk about this, please?

1702
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,358
- Chin up!
- Keep it up, mate!

1703
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,559
Do you know, Mr Doyle, sir?

1704
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,595
Oh.

1705
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,398
I'm the assistant coach.

1706
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,038
Oh. Oh, really.
What's your name?

1707
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,192
- Uh, Mr Ghoshdashtidar.
- Gosh...

1708
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,235
- Ghosh...
- Gah...

1709
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,912
OK, just call me John.

1710
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,958
It was me who discovered
his potential.

1711
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,679
I can't breathe.

1712
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,634
My head's gonna explode.

1713
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,278
He's not gonna make it.

1714
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,918
L... I have to stop.

1715
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,319
- I have to stop this.
- No.

1716
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,469
- I'm sorry.
- No, you can't.
What are you doing?

1717
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,709
You can't stop.
You're nearly there.

1718
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,199
What? How much further?

1719
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,511
Lt... It's a little, tiny...
Nine miles.

1720
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,198
OK. OK.

1721
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,274
Oh, no.

1722
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,395
What?

1723
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,954
He's hit it.

1724
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,358
OK, baby,
let's get you to bed.

1725
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,035
Jakey.

1726
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,111
...by the crowds
and the fun runners.
- Dennis.

1727
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,633
- For those of you
just joining us...
- Dennis?

1728
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,314
It looks like Dennis Doyle, a
clothing store security guard...

1729
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,311
running for the last ten
and three quarter hours...

1730
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,197
on basically one leg...

1731
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:57,716
is refusing to rest
until this race is run.

1732
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,791
Unbelievable!

1733
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,993
You've never finished anything
in your entire life, Dennis.

1734
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,270
All you're gonna
wanna do is give up.

1735
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,634
I'm not the quitter!

1736
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,676
That's exactly
what you're gonna do, Dennis.

1737
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,830
Go on, run away!
Run away!

1738
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,433
That's what you always do!

1739
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,515
Dennis!

1740
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,835
Dennis!

1741
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,553
Dennis?

1742
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,759
Oh, I don't believe this.

1743
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,159
Yeah, boy, yes!

1744
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,719
He's still going!

1745
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,837
Go on, you beautiful man!

1746
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,797
Apologies there,
ladies and gentlemen, uh...

1747
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,440
but it's, uh, really rather hard
not to get caught up...

1748
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,839
in the drama of it all.

1749
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,752
Now let's take one more look
at how Dennis broke that ankle.

1750
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:20,875
And here it is.

1751
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,313
It appears
that the runner there...

1752
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,551
next to Mr Doyle
is involved in some way.

1753
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,189
In fact, if we look at it again
here... yes!

1754
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,350
He deliberately trips him!

1755
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,953
Bastard!

1756
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,268
Apologies again, uh...

1757
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,237
That didn't...
That's not what happened.

1758
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,753
That is...
That... That didn't happen.

1759
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,398
I can't believe this.

1760
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,435
I don't believe it, either.

1761
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,475
I don't understand that.

1762
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,515
What is that?

1763
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,953
Honey. Honey...

1764
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,999
That angle makes it look, but...
He tripped me.

1765
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,837
He tripped me! Yes, he did!

1766
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,514
- Go, Dennis!
- It's him! Dennis!

1767
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,668
Go, Dennis!

1768
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,474
I can't believe this.

1769
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,754
Come on, honey.

1770
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,159
Please, like I'm gonna do that.

1771
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,028
What are you...
Are you kidding me?

1772
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,235
Honey.

1773
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,869
All right, look,
I'm just... I'm not...

1774
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,393
I'm not myself, OK?

1775
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,158
I haven't been myself
for a long time.

1776
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,673
Work has not been...

1777
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,277
It's, uh...

1778
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,315
It's just this city, you know?

1779
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,311
It's just...
It's really hard here for me.

1780
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,913
You know,
everyone's so polite here...

1781
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,956
and it's like the food and the...
and the... and the ca...

1782
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,359
I just don't... I don't
know what happened to me.

1783
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,078
I don't know what...
It's just this place.

1784
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:29,229
It's this place, you know?

1785
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,153
And if we... I just know it's
gonna be better once we move.

1786
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,753
- Move?
- To Chicago.

1787
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,034
What?

1788
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,269
Too soon?

1789
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,315
Oh!

1790
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,879
- Come on, Jake.
- Libby, wh...

1791
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,154
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

1792
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,031
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Dennis?

1793
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,314
You can't be serious.

1794
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,198
The guy left you
at the altar pregnant.

1795
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,274
Nobody's perfect.

1796
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,355
Libby.

1797
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,032
Libby! L...

1798
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,109
What a shithead.

1799
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,235
Jake.

1800
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,078
Hey. I know you feel bad.

1801
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,149
I know you're
in incredible pain...

1802
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,549
but you are so close
to me going on holiday.

1803
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,435
Come on.

1804
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,628
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1805
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:24,792
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1806
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,953
Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

1807
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,634
As we draw tantalizingly
close to the finish line...

1808
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,358
here at St. Paul's Cathedral...

1809
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,795
it's safe to say,
it's been a very long day...

1810
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,632
for myself and my cameraman.

1811
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:40,473
It's been a very long day
for you watching at home...

1812
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,515
but for Dennis Doyle...

1813
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,068
it's been the single longest day
of his life.

1814
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,395
Come on, Dennis!

1815
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,395
Good work, Dennis!

1816
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,959
Hey! Move along!

1817
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:07,995
That's it. You're there.

1818
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,718
You're sixty feet.

1819
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,074
Fifty... Fifty-eight feet.

1820
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,229
Call it fifty-six
and a half feet...

1821
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,275
and you're there. Come on.

1822
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,352
That's my man! My man!

1823
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,789
Come on, come on!

1824
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,395
Dennis, come on.

1825
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,550
Stay down, you shamble of a man.

1826
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,755
Don't get up.

1827
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,835
Dennis!

1828
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:46,829
Dennis, come on, get up.

1829
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,399
Dennis, you're
at the finish line. Get up.

1830
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,032
Dennis, this looks bad.
People are talking.

1831
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,155
Get up.

1832
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:06,675
Hello, Dennis?

1833
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,757
- Dennis!
- Dad!

1834
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,270
Dennis!

1835
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,395
Dad!

1836
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,512
Go on! You've got it! Go on!

1837
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,710
Come on, Dennis! Yeah!

1838
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,555
Yeah!

1839
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:54,995
Dad!

1840
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,108
That was a really stupid thing
you did out there today.

1841
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,952
Don't go to Chicago.

1842
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,553
Dad, you won!

1843
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,114
He's done it!

1844
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,838
He's actually done it!

1845
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:09,989
This morning...

1846
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,436
Dennis Doyle was a humble
shop worker from North London!

1847
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,988
Tonight, he goes home a hero!

1848
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,798
Oh, yay.

1849
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,074
And look at that!

1850
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,275
- God damn it.
- This extraordinary man...

1851
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,191
collapses into the arms of...

1852
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,635
I think it's backwards here...
the woman he loves!

1853
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,109
And, look! He's got a son!

1854
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,156
I didn't know he had a son!

1855
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,753
Did you know he had a son?

1856
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,278
- Hello, Dennis.
- Hey.

1857
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,759
- Hi.
- Hi.

1858
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,478
Jake, your dad's here!

1859
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,039
How's it goin'?

1860
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,348
- Pretty good.
- Good.

1861
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,714
- You?
- Yeah.

1862
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,199
Yeah, not bad.

1863
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,349
You still running?

1864
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,317
Every day, hopefully
in the right direction.

1865
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,478
Yeah. So...

1866
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,668
Um, Libby,
I was thinkin', um...

1867
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,395
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, you.

1868
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:27,115
Uh, it doesn't matter,
actually.

1869
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,394
I'll, um...

1870
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,674
I'll sp... I'll ca...
I'll speak to you later.

1871
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,273
- OK.
- Say goodbye to your mom.

1872
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,429
Bye, Mom.

1873
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:33,475
Bye. I'll see you later.

1874
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,675
Bye.

1875
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,517
Libby, I was wondering,
would you like to go...

1876
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,431
and have some dinner
with me next week?

1877
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,275
You don't have to.
It's not, uh...

1878
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:55,509
Yeah.

1879
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,874
Uh... huh?

1880
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,439
I mean, wow.

1881
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,589
It'd be nice.

1882
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,477
Yeah. Well, it would be.

1883
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,318
I'll, um...
I'll give you a call.

1884
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,389
OK.

1885
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,913
Don't know why I did that.
It's just...

1886
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,714
OK. Ready?

1887
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,835
Yeah.

1888
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,952
Hello!

1889
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,519
Hello, Dennis!

1890
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,274
Mr G.

1891
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,677
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello.

1892
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,318
I was just doing my spin class.

1893
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,355
It's great fun, isn't it?

1894
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,795
Oh, it's an amazing workout!

1895
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,438
Dad comin' up behind
the young contender.

1896
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,669
Come on! Jake!

1897
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,318
Oh, he takes the ball from Jake!

1898
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,709
He has the ball! He's clear!

1899
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,119
Dad! Pass it!

1900
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,435
Dad is clear!

1901
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,192
Give it!

1902
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,032
I'll give you one, too.

1903
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,111
OK, let's go. Good game.

1904
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,792
Jake to Mr G.

1905
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,999
Yeah, thank you very much.

1906
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,149
Take over, Mr G.

1907
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,509
There you go, Mr G.

1908
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:03,079
All right, I'm gonna...
Completely illegal move there.

1909
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,912
Picks up the player,
runs with him.

1910
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,319
Runs with him all the way.

1911
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,879
Dad, that's illegal!

1912
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,555
But that's not all.

1913
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,151
Because the guy,
he can't barely walk, OK...

1914
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,151
let alone run,
but he keeps going...

1915
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,959
and twenty-five miles
on a shattered ankle.

1916
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,029
And you know how he did that?

1917
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,269
You know what he said
was the one thing...

1918
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,395
