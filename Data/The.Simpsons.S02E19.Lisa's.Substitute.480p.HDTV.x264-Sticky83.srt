00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,435
<i>Previously on Lost.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,035
Oh God.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,135
It's not your fault
she's dead. It's mine.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,135
I convinced her to stay 'cause
I didn't want to be alone.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,335
You can probably make it
back to the temple by nightfall.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,835
I'm sorry you had
to see me like that.

7
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:27,436
Hello, Richard.

8
00:00:27,437 --> 00:00:28,971
- You?
- Me.

9
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:34,076
I am very disappointed
in all of you!

10
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,089
So what were you
doing in Australia?

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,558
- Business or pleasure?
- Actually, I went on a walkabout.

12
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,827
Welcome to Los Angeles.

13
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,134
- Bye, daddy.
- Bye, sweetie.

14
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:41,110
Oh, come on.

15
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,607
John?

16
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:16,612
Are you okay?

17
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:18,581
Yeah. I'm fine.

18
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:20,316
Oh.

19
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:22,284
Come on, let's get you inside.

20
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:24,220
Okay.

21
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:27,490
Well, how long will that take?

22
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:30,159
The wedding is in October.

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,395
Look, I'm gonna just have
to call you back. Yeah.

24
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:37,399
I am so sick of caterers

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,301
and bands

26
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:43,639
and picking fabrics
for chair backs.

27
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,608
What do you say we just...

28
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:49,111
get my parents and your dad

29
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:51,814
and do it shotgun
style in Vegas?

30
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:55,017
No. You deserve better
than that, Helen.

31
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:58,220
And we can do this.
I know we can.

32
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:02,892
I like...

33
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:04,226
this one.

34
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:07,162
- That one?
- I meant this one.

35
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:10,633
You are a very sweet man.

36
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:11,934
Mmm.

37
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:13,402
I know.

38
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:16,906
So how was the conference?

39
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:20,409
Boring.

40
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:25,681
Who's, uh, who's Dr.
Jack Shephard?

41
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:27,683
Oh, I met him at lost luggage

42
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:30,052
when I went to
fill out the forms.

43
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:32,421
He... he lost something, too.

44
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:33,956
He's a spinal surgeon?

45
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:35,658
Yeah. Nice guy.

46
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,726
He offered me a free consult.

47
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:39,762
You should call him.

48
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:42,164
Oh, he was just
being polite, Helen.

49
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:45,034
So what?

50
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:47,169
I mean...

51
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,073
What are the odds of you just
running into a spinal surgeon?

52
00:03:51,074 --> 00:03:54,276
I mean, who knows?

53
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:56,111
maybe it's destiny.

54
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:58,747
Maybe it is.

55
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,023
All right, Richard.

56
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:18,160
Time to talk.

57
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:27,160
Lost Season 6 Episode 4
"The Substitute"

58
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,869
Welcome back, Colonel.

59
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,471
Wow.

60
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:06,707
You got a nice tan in Australia.

61
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,375
Did you miss us?

62
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,310
Sure I did, Randy.

63
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:12,880
So... how was the
conference, John?

64
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:15,349
Uh, it was okay.
I didn't really learn anything.

65
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,118
No? But, um, I made some
good contacts, though.

66
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,787
Really? That's interesting.

67
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:21,789
See, uh, Ken Fisher called
and said you had to cancel

68
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,825
your lunch with him.

69
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:27,795
Right, right. I was a little
under the weather that day.

70
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:30,464
- Uh... probably jet lag.
- Really?

71
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:32,033
'cause then the
seminar people called

72
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:34,968
and said you hadn't picked
up your credentials.

73
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:36,837
I did some checking,

74
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:39,807
and it seems that you didn't
attend a single event.

75
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:42,910
Since we sent you to Sydney
on the company's dime...

76
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:44,945
- where the hell were you?
- Look, Randy, I'm really sorry, I'm...

77
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:48,416
why don't we just call
it my vacation week?

78
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,418
I thought you wanted that
vacation week in October?

79
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,487
You know, for your wedding.

80
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:55,557
Please, Randy. I-I know
I shouldn't have lied,

81
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:57,459
but where I was...

82
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:01,663
it's personal,

83
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:03,932
and I... and I really don't
want to talk about it.

84
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,434
Okay, John.

85
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,635
Hey, you're fired.

86
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:18,712
Thirsty?

87
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,556
Richard, I'm sorry I hit you
in the throat and dragged

88
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:32,027
you off the beach,
but I had to do something.

89
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:36,163
- What do you want?
- What I've always wanted...

90
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,866
for you to come with me.

91
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:41,835
Why do you look like John Locke?

92
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,805
I knew he'd get me
access to Jacob.

93
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:47,107
Because John's a candidate,

94
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:49,743
or at least he was a candidate.

95
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:51,913
What do you mean...

96
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:55,148
what do you mean, "a candidate"?

97
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:59,487
- Didn't Jacob tell you any of this?
- Any of what?

98
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:02,856
Oh, Richard, I'm sorry.

99
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,726
You mean, you've been doing
everything he told you

100
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:08,495
all this time, and
he never said why?

101
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,466
I would never have
done that to you.

102
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:13,902
I would never have
kept you in the dark.

103
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:14,637
And... and what would
you have done?

104
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:16,873
I would have treated
you with respect.

105
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:21,508
Come with me, and I promise

106
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:24,545
I'll tell you everything.

107
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:28,682
No.

108
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:31,585
Are you sure about that, Richard?
Because people seldom

109
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:34,588
get a second chance.

110
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:37,491
I'm not going anywhere with you.

111
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:42,296
All right...

112
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:52,105
What?

113
00:08:57,212 --> 00:09:00,582
I'll be seeing you, Richard,
sooner than you think.

114
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,944
Am I interrupting?

115
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,349
Tell me what happened to them.

116
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,217
All right.

117
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:39,186
There's a fairly
reasonable chance

118
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:41,054
that you won't believe me.

119
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,196
Try me.

120
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:51,898
John Locke killed them.

121
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,501
- All by himself?
- Yes.

122
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:57,104
He turned into a
pillar of black smoke,

123
00:09:57,105 --> 00:09:59,573
and he killed them
right before my eyes.

124
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:02,409
Did it kill Jacob as well?

125
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,144
Yes.

126
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,546
Then where's his body?

127
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:09,816
Locke kicked him into the fire,
and he burned away.

128
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,604
Locke... do you know why he
carried Richard out into the jungle?

129
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:39,179
He's recruiting.

130
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:41,951
Hello, James.

131
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,694
I thought you were dead.

132
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:55,365
I am.

133
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,069
Here's to bein' dead.

134
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:34,109
You're taking this
extremely well.

135
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,312
Taking what extremely well?

136
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:38,880
That I'm here.

137
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:42,016
I don't give a
damn if you're dead

138
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:44,252
or time travelin' or...

139
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:46,688
the ghost of Christmas past.

140
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:49,157
All I care about
is this whiskey.

141
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:52,227
So bottom's up,

142
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:55,130
then get the hell
out of my house.

143
00:12:58,635 --> 00:13:00,569
This isn't your house, James.

144
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,572
The hell it ain't.

145
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:06,041
No. You just lived
here for a while.

146
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:09,344
This was never your house.

147
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:13,949
Who are you?

148
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,818
You sure as hell
ain't John Locke.

149
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:19,621
What makes you say that?

150
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:21,656
'Cause Locke was scared,

151
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:25,727
even when he was
pretending he wasn't.

152
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:27,529
But you...

153
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:31,699
you ain't scared.

154
00:13:37,506 --> 00:13:41,442
What if I told you I was
the person who could answer

155
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:44,379
the most important
question in the world?

156
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:54,322
And what question is that?

157
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:58,526
Why are you on this island?

158
00:13:58,527 --> 00:14:00,562
I'm on this island

159
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:02,931
because my plane crashed,

160
00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:06,134
'cause my raft blew up,

161
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:09,571
because the helicopter I was
on was riding one to heavy.

162
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:11,940
That's not why you're here...

163
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,511
and if you come with me...

164
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:18,213
I can prove it.

165
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:26,422
Well, I guess I better
put some pants on.

166
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,641
Okay.

167
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:48,710
Okay.

168
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,420
Come on!

169
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:01,422
Aw, damn it!

170
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:09,998
Dude?

171
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,599
Dude!

172
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,571
What are you doing?

173
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:19,240
What am I doing?
What the hell are you doing?

174
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,076
You ever park a car in your life?
You're practically in my spot!

175
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:22,444
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

176
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:25,546
But, you know, there's a
handicap spot right over here.

177
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:28,715
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
But I don't have to park there.

178
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:32,253
I can park anywhere I want.
You need to stay

179
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:33,589
inside the lines.

180
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,391
I'm really sorry.
They were supposed to

181
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,860
reserve a spot for me.
So, you know,

182
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:40,762
I just parked here.

183
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,832
I haven't seen you before.
You work here?

184
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,503
Actually, I own the company.

185
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,278
Hugo Reyes.

186
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,681
John Locke.

187
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:02,450
Cool. What do you do here, John?

188
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,886
Uh, actually, nothing.
My boss just fired me.

189
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:06,854
Oh? Who's your boss?

190
00:16:06,855 --> 00:16:08,856
His name is Randy. But, uh...

191
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:10,625
- Randy Nations?
- Yeah. Yes.

192
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,360
Yeah, that guy is a huge douche.

193
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:15,329
You want me to
talk to him for ya?

194
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,664
No, that's okay.

195
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,102
Tell you what, John.

196
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:23,471
I own a temp agency, too.

197
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:25,873
Call this number

198
00:16:25,874 --> 00:16:27,909
and tell 'em that Hugo said

199
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,980
to hook you up with
a new job, pronto.

200
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:35,950
And chin up.

201
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:38,453
Things are gonna work out.

202
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:47,962
Whew.

203
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:50,498
He's gettin' pretty ripe.

204
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:56,337
Where is everybody?

205
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:59,507
They left. They said they
were going to the temple.

206
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:01,943
Right now it's the safest
place on the island.

207
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:05,146
- We should go there, too.
- Are you all right?

208
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,351
I'm fine.

209
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:14,155
Come on, let's get out of here.

210
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:16,091
What makes you think
that I'm going with you?

211
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:19,460
Because you want to find Jin.

212
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:21,896
What do you know
about my husband?

213
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:26,834
I know that if he's on the
island and he's alive,

214
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:29,270
then he'll be at the temple.

215
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:34,075
Let's get moving.

216
00:17:35,377 --> 00:17:36,944
What about John?

217
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:40,882
We need to bury him.

218
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:51,225
What were you doing alone
in that house, James?

219
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:54,597
- Drinkin'.
- Where's the rest of your friends?

220
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,733
- Some temple somewhere.
- Why aren't you with 'em?

221
00:17:58,134 --> 00:18:01,269
You know what?
how about we just don't talk?

222
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,037
You got it.

223
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:08,576
Who the hell's that?

224
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:11,012
- You can see him?
- The kid?

225
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:12,748
Hell, yeah,
I can see him.

226
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:15,682
- Hey!
- What...

227
00:18:26,962 --> 00:18:28,296
Uhh!

228
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:39,974
You know the rules.

229
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:41,709
You can't kill him.

230
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:47,882
Don't tell me what I can't do.

231
00:18:55,657 --> 00:19:01,162
Don't tell me what I can't do!

232
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:05,440
Locke!

233
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:09,440
Locke!

234
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:14,483
Look, whoever you are,
you got about 20 seconds,

235
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:16,685
and then I'm outta here!

236
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:22,891
- Where is he?
- What the hell are you doing here?

237
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:26,428
- Where is he?
- Locke? Ran off into the jungle after some kid.

238
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:28,064
- We need to go now.
- Go where?

239
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:30,767
- To the temple. Let's go. Let's go.
- You know what?

240
00:19:30,968 --> 00:19:32,502
I've been to the temple.
I think I'm sticking with Locke.

241
00:19:32,903 --> 00:19:36,004
- That man is not John Locke.
- I know.

242
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:38,140
- Then why are you with him?
- Because he's got answers,

243
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:40,108
says he knows why
I'm on this island... Unless you

244
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:41,245
- wanna tell me why I'm here, Richard.
- Don't be naive.

245
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,542
He's not gonna
tell you anything.

246
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:44,782
- He's gonna kill you.
- If he wanted to kill me,

247
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:45,638
he could've done it a
dozen times already.

248
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:47,252
You don't understand
what you're dealing with.

249
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,821
He doesn't just want you dead.
He wants everyone dead...

250
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:53,123
everyone you care about,
all of them... and he won't stop.

251
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:01,696
Who you talking to?

252
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:03,999
Nobody.

253
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,901
You ever catch up with the kid?

254
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:08,103
What kid?

255
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:11,006
Right.

256
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:13,475
- Let's get on with it, shall we?
- Yes, James.

257
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:15,777
Les get on with it.

258
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:24,219
What kind of animal would
you describe yourself as?

259
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:27,022
Excuse me?

260
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:31,827
What kind of animal would
you describe yourself as?

261
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:34,563
Uh... I-I don't know what
that has to do with...

262
00:20:34,564 --> 00:20:38,200
Just say whatever comes to mind.

263
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:42,404
Would you describe yourself
as a people person?

264
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:47,542
May I speak to your supervisor?

265
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:51,513
Of course.

266
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:54,115
I'll go get her.

267
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:01,623
Good morning, Mr... Locke?

268
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:02,991
Yeah.

269
00:21:02,992 --> 00:21:05,026
I'm Rose Nadler,
the office supervisor.

270
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:06,928
What can I do for you?

271
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,364
Uh, what you can do, Ms. Nadler,

272
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:12,334
is spare me the question about
what kind of animal I am

273
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:14,236
and hopefully place me in a job.

274
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:15,604
Absolutely.

275
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:18,073
What kind of placement
are you looking for?

276
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:19,741
Well, I see here
that you have a listing

277
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:22,744
- for a site coordinator.
- Construction site coordinator.

278
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:25,847
Uh, I'm not sure
that's a good match.

279
00:21:25,848 --> 00:21:27,363
Well, if experience
is the issue,

280
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:29,017
- I have...
- Experience isn't the issue.

281
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:33,622
Look, Mr. Reyes told me

282
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:36,525
if I came down here,
I would be taken care of.

283
00:21:36,526 --> 00:21:39,528
And Mr. Reyes is my boss,
so if he said that,

284
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:41,496
I can make it happen of you.

285
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:43,965
If you want to work
construction, you got it.

286
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:45,901
- Thank you.
- I'm not finished.

287
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:48,236
I will send you
down there tomorrow,

288
00:21:48,237 --> 00:21:50,305
and then the day after,

289
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:52,574
you will be back in my office.

290
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:55,610
Look...

291
00:21:55,611 --> 00:22:00,081
Mr. Locke, let's try to be
a little more realistic.

292
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:03,251
And what do you
know about realistic?

293
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:09,858
I have cancer.

294
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:11,526
Terminal cancer.

295
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:14,996
I'm sorry.

296
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:17,399
When the doctors first told me,

297
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,602
I had a hard time accepting it.

298
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:24,372
But eventually, I got
past the denial part

299
00:22:24,373 --> 00:22:29,077
and I got back to living
whatever life I've got left.

300
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:32,914
So...

301
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:37,319
How about we find you a job you can do?

302
00:22:44,758 --> 00:22:46,494
Do you read?

303
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:47,761
Excuse me?

304
00:22:47,762 --> 00:22:49,730
Books. You read books?

305
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:52,566
Sure. Who doesn't?

306
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:56,637
My favorite's Steinbeck,
"Of mice and men."

307
00:22:56,638 --> 00:22:58,305
You know that one?

308
00:22:58,306 --> 00:23:00,808
Nope. A little after my time.

309
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:07,381
It's about these two guys,
George and Lennie.

310
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:09,583
Lennie's kind of slow,

311
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:12,319
causing George problems.

312
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,788
So George walks him
out in the woods,

313
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:17,324
tells him to look out
yonder and picture

314
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:20,294
the pretty little house
they're gonna live in one day.

315
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:22,763
And he shoots Lennie in
the back of the head.

316
00:23:22,764 --> 00:23:26,468
Well, that doesn't sound
like a happy ending.

317
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:27,368
It aint.

318
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,400
What's on your mind, James?

319
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:35,175
I'm wondering what
would happen to you

320
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:37,778
if I put a bullet in your head.

321
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:41,081
Mmm. Why don't we find out?

322
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:47,021
What are you?

323
00:23:49,624 --> 00:23:52,026
What I am is trapped,

324
00:23:53,628 --> 00:23:56,130
and I've been
trapped for so long,

325
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:59,466
that I don't even remember
what it feels like to be free.

326
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:01,402
Maybe you can understand that.

327
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:06,173
But before I was trapped,
I was a man, James, just like you.

328
00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:08,676
I have a hard time
believing that.

329
00:24:08,677 --> 00:24:11,512
Well, you can believe whatever
you want, but that's the truth.

330
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:15,382
I know what it's
like to feel joy,

331
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:19,186
to feel pain, anger, fear...

332
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:22,122
to experience betrayal.

333
00:24:22,123 --> 00:24:25,392
I know what it's like to
lose someone you love.

334
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:32,099
If you wanna shoot me, shoot me.

335
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,369
But you're so close, James,

336
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,339
it would be such a
shame to turn back now.

337
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,936
Why did you have to bring him to
the statue in the first place?

338
00:25:06,937 --> 00:25:08,604
Because the people there
need to see the face of

339
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:10,040
what they're up against.

340
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,975
And what's to stop
what they're up against

341
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:15,878
from changing his face?
- He can't. Not anymore.

342
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:19,048
He's stuck this way.

343
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,432
Does anyone want
to say anything?

344
00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:14,804
Didn't any of you know him?

345
00:26:19,643 --> 00:26:21,611
All right, I knew him.

346
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:28,184
John Locke was a...

347
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:37,994
a believer. He was a
man of faith. He was...

348
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:42,532
a much better man...

349
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,002
than I will ever be...

350
00:26:48,872 --> 00:26:51,307
and I'm very sorry
I murdered him.

351
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,555
This is the weirdest
damn funeral

352
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:07,056
I've ever been to.

353
00:27:57,307 --> 00:27:59,675
Hello. Dr. Shephard's office.

354
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:01,010
Hello?

355
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:03,646
Can I help you?

356
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:05,815
No. No, you can't.

357
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:09,352
Who was that on the phone?

358
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:10,786
Mmm, no one.

359
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:12,989
- No one?
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,924
John, I just heard you
talking on the phone.

361
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:18,928
I was, uh,

362
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:21,330
I was calling Dr. Shephard.

363
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:27,703
Well, good for you.
When are you gonna see him?

364
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:30,172
I'm not gonna see him.

365
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:31,833
Well, I-I don't understand.

366
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:34,477
- Why wouldn't you want...
- I got fired, Helen.

367
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,952
Coming!

368
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:44,954
Ma'am? Oceanic courier.

369
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:47,690
I'm delivering
your lost luggage.

370
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:49,525
All right.

371
00:28:51,228 --> 00:28:54,397
Sign here to accept
the delivery.

372
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,567
- Thanks.
- Okay, thanks.

373
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:08,711
Okay, John.

374
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:13,849
Now talk to me.

375
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,951
How did you get fired?

376
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:21,724
I lied to Randy. I didn't go
to the conference in Sydney.

377
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:24,260
What?

378
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:27,029
Open the case, Helen.

379
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:55,458
W-what are these for?

380
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,827
My walkabout.

381
00:29:57,828 --> 00:29:59,161
Your... y-your what?

382
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:01,764
My walkabout.

383
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:04,066
An adventure in the outback...

384
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,735
man against nature.

385
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:08,537
But they wouldn't let me go.

386
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:10,940
And... and I sat there
yelling at them,

387
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:12,608
shouting at them,

388
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:16,946
that they couldn't tell
me what I can't do.

389
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:18,814
But they were right.

390
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,888
I'm sick of imagining

391
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:28,724
what my life could be out
of this chair, Helen.

392
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:31,293
What it would be like to...

393
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:34,230
walk down the aisle with you,

394
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:36,766
'cause it's not gonna happen.

395
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:41,737
So if you need me
to see more doctors,

396
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:44,173
if, uh... have more consults,

397
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:45,809
if you need me to get
out of this chair,

398
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,444
I don't blame you.

399
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:50,146
But I don't want you
to spend your life

400
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:53,516
waiting for a miracle,
Helen, because...

401
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,985
there is no such thing.

402
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:11,834
There are miracles, John.

403
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,973
And the only thing,

404
00:31:17,974 --> 00:31:20,643
I was ever waiting for...

405
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:24,180
was you.

406
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:55,845
Nice view.

407
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:58,147
Now what?

408
00:31:58,148 --> 00:31:59,982
Now we go down.

409
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:03,452
Down where?

410
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:06,288
Down there.

411
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,626
No offence, but
you already died,

412
00:32:10,627 --> 00:32:13,395
so it's great that this
is not a big deal for you.

413
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:15,331
But if you think I'm
climbin' down there first,

414
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:17,699
you are off your damn nut.
- It's no problem. I'll go first.

415
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:38,487
You coming, James?

416
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:04,880
Ohh!

417
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:25,401
James!

418
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:27,836
Locke!

419
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:33,409
Jump. I got you. Come on!

420
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,245
Come on, I got you! Come on!

421
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:37,680
Come on!

422
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:39,882
Uhh! Come on!

423
00:33:39,883 --> 00:33:41,952
Aah! Look out!

424
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:20,723
What is this place?

425
00:34:42,412 --> 00:34:44,346
What the hell's that all about?

426
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:46,649
Inside joke.

427
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,218
So this is what you
wanted me to see...

428
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,087
a hole in the cliff with
some rocks on a scale?

429
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:53,789
That's why I'm here?

430
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:58,727
No.

431
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:14,543
That's why you're here.

432
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:23,819
That, James,
is why you're all here.

433
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,569
All right, dig it out.
Come on. All the way.

434
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,472
No cheatin'. Come on, now.
Come on, all the way.

435
00:35:50,473 --> 00:35:52,307
You can catch 'em.
You can catch 'em.

436
00:35:52,308 --> 00:35:54,275
Come on, dig it out.

437
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:57,812
Bring it in now.
Bring it in all the way.

438
00:35:57,813 --> 00:36:00,281
Good job. Good job.

439
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:07,255
All right, everyone!

440
00:36:07,256 --> 00:36:10,291
Please open your textbooks
to chapter four.

441
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:14,095
Today we are going
to talk about...

442
00:36:14,096 --> 00:36:16,498
the human reproductive system.

443
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,671
Do you know where the teach...

444
00:36:23,672 --> 00:36:26,007
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where the teachers' lounge is?

445
00:36:26,008 --> 00:36:28,243
- Yeah, it's over there.
- Thank you.

446
00:36:30,946 --> 00:36:34,315
All right, I know I
sound like a broken record,

447
00:36:34,316 --> 00:36:36,651
but how many times do
we have to go over this?

448
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:39,387
If you have the
last cup of coffee,

449
00:36:39,388 --> 00:36:41,422
you remove the filter

450
00:36:41,423 --> 00:36:44,092
and throw it away.

451
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:46,528
Fear not.
I will make a fresh pot.

452
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:48,730
Actually, I was just
hoping for some Earl Grey.

453
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:50,665
Tea?

454
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,368
Now there's a gentleman's drink.

455
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:56,404
I don't believe we've met.
Ben Linus. European history.

456
00:36:56,405 --> 00:36:59,574
- John Locke. Substitute.
- Well, welcome.

457
00:37:14,757 --> 00:37:17,158
Who wrote all this?

458
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,127
His name was Jacob.

459
00:37:19,128 --> 00:37:21,029
"Was", Jacob?

460
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,598
He died yesterday.

461
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,640
You don't seem too
upset about it.

462
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:34,409
I'm not.

463
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:40,014
Why are all the
names crossed out?

464
00:37:40,015 --> 00:37:43,184
They're not all crossed out.

465
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:44,886
"Shephard."

466
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:48,690
That'd be Jack Shephard?

467
00:37:57,812 --> 00:38:00,947
And he's not the only one.

468
00:38:02,304 --> 00:38:04,672
"Reyes."

469
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,274
That's Hugo, right?

470
00:38:09,757 --> 00:38:13,277
- What's the eight about?
- Jacob had a thing for numbers.

471
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,317
"16. Jarrah."

472
00:38:21,452 --> 00:38:24,492
"42. Kwon." I don't know
if it's Sun or if it's Jin.

473
00:38:29,295 --> 00:38:32,798
Here. "4. Locke."

474
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:37,452
I think we both know him.

475
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,135
Last but not least...

476
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:49,873
"number 15. Ford."

477
00:38:52,011 --> 00:38:53,245
That would be you.

478
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:55,647
Why would he write
my name on this wall?

479
00:38:55,648 --> 00:38:59,051
I never even met the guy.
- Oh, no, I'm sure you did meet Jacob.

480
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:07,620
At some point in your life, James,
probably when you were young,

481
00:39:07,624 --> 00:39:11,393
when you were miserable and
vulnerable, he came to you.

482
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:13,028
He manipulated you,

483
00:39:13,029 --> 00:39:15,597
pulled your strings
like you were a puppet.

484
00:39:15,598 --> 00:39:18,433
And as a result, choices that
you thought you made

485
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:21,202
were never really
choices at all.

486
00:39:21,203 --> 00:39:23,338
He was pushing you, James.

487
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:26,708
Pushing you...

488
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:28,243
to the island.

489
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:32,247
Why the hell would he do that?

490
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:35,283
Because, you're a candidate.

491
00:39:35,284 --> 00:39:36,918
Candidate for what?

492
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:40,255
He thought he was the
protector of this place,

493
00:39:40,256 --> 00:39:42,557
and you James,
have been nominated

494
00:39:42,558 --> 00:39:44,693
to take over that job.

495
00:39:44,694 --> 00:39:47,228
What does that mean?

496
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:49,197
It means you've
got three choices.

497
00:39:49,198 --> 00:39:54,436
First, you can do nothing and...

498
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:56,571
see how all this plays out.

499
00:39:58,407 --> 00:40:00,141
And possibly,

500
00:40:00,142 --> 00:40:01,876
your name...

501
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:04,279
will get crossed out.

502
00:40:06,515 --> 00:40:07,982
Second option,

503
00:40:07,983 --> 00:40:10,685
you can accept the job,

504
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:14,489
become the new Jacob
and protect the island.

505
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,858
Protect it from what?

506
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:18,259
From nothing, James.

507
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,894
That's the joke,

508
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,896
there's nothing to
protect it from.

509
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:23,798
It's just a damn island.

510
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:26,735
And it will be perfectly
fine without Jacob or you,

511
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:32,140
or any of the other people
whose lives he wasted.

512
00:40:35,745 --> 00:40:37,812
You said there
were three choices.

513
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:42,817
The third choice, James,
is that we just go.

514
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:46,388
We just get the
hell off this island

515
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:48,690
and we never look back.

516
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:51,159
And how do we do that?

517
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:54,629
Together.

518
00:41:04,473 --> 00:41:07,976
So what do you say, James?

519
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:10,545
Are you ready to go home?

520
00:41:20,156 --> 00:41:21,656
Hell, yes.
