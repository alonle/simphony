00:00:02,152 --> 00:00:05,218
The Simpsons S19E01 (JABF20)
He Loves to Fly and He D'ohs

2
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:09,521
I will not wait 20 years
to make another movie

3
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:44,483
My summer love.

4
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,146
All right,

5
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:55,798
next on my shoping list...

6
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:58,700
a new phone.

7
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,486
Attention, shoppers,

8
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:03,516
iPhones now 20 cents.

9
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:06,254
What happened to that mini-cell
phone I gave you, sir?

10
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:09,240
Ooh, I thought that
was a lemon drop.

11
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:13,076
I'll go get the
number de-listed.

12
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:19,563
Well, well.

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,006
What have we here?

14
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,441
Why do I need another penny?

15
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:26,813
I have billions.

16
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:28,590
Still, if I don't take it,

17
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:30,392
that hoodlum over there might.

18
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:33,841
All right, penny,

19
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:35,492
prepare to be pinched.

20
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:37,931
Come to Papa.

21
00:01:40,756 --> 00:01:41,710
Help...

22
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:42,932
me!

23
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:43,723
Help...

24
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:44,652
me!

25
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:45,513
Help...

26
00:01:45,777 --> 00:01:46,563
me!

27
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,162
I guess this is the end.

28
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:56,130
I just wish I'd spent more
time at the office.

29
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,640
Hey, you're not a penny.

30
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:06,931
You saved my life

31
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:08,910
There must be something I can do for you.

32
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:10,253
A cookie. No, a car.

33
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:10,982
No, a cookie.

34
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:13,002
You're getting a free dinner.

35
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:13,813
With...

36
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:14,143
Yeah?

37
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:14,913
...me.

38
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:16,463
"Me"? But that's you.

39
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:18,571
I'll pick you up
at 5:00 tomorrow.

40
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:20,820
And I'll pick you up right now.

41
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:25,840
Got it.

42
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,530
See you at 5:00, then.

43
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:32,120
Dinner with Mr. Burns.

44
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:33,841
What a waste of my precious,

45
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:35,562
precious Saturday night.

46
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,392
Hey, Dad, have fun
with your boyfriend.

47
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:39,690
He is not my boyfriend!

48
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:42,102
So, Simpson,

49
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:44,230
I hear you like pizza pie.

50
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:45,091
I do.

51
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:45,940
My favorite

52
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,162
is Chicago deep-dish.

53
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:48,291
Chicago, eh?

54
00:02:48,358 --> 00:02:50,590
Well, what if I took us there now?

55
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:52,293
Drive to Chicago?

56
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:53,602
I don't have time for that.

57
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,410
I have to be back
at work on Monday,

58
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:57,182
and my boss is a total jerk.

59
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:59,511
Who said anything about drive?

60
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,911
A p-p-p-private jet!

61
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:09,382
Now would you care
for some sushi?

62
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:12,723
yeah, but I'm
on a plane, idiot.

63
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:16,172
My name is Svetlana,

64
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:18,171
but you can call me "Hey, baby."

65
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:22,082
And just so you know,

66
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,710
she'll do anything for you.

67
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,200
Anything except sex.

68
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,812
And I do mean

69
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,403
anything.

70
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,260
I'm aroused...

71
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:34,210
and confused.

72
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:36,313
...Scratchy Show!

73
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,481
Stewardess!

74
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,323
Sorry, everyone.

75
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:01,273
Air traffic control says we have

76
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:04,432
to spend another three hours
on the tarmac.

77
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:10,041
This is wonderful.

78
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:12,082
Now, why don't you listen
to the musical stylings

79
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,463
of Mr. Lionel Richie?

80
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:14,482
Oh, my God,

81
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,610
Lionel Richie!

82
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:18,493
Can you sing "Say You Say Me,"
but make it about beer?

83
00:04:18,497 --> 00:04:19,681
Sure, I guess.

84
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:21,381
Hey, you,

85
00:04:21,556 --> 00:04:23,100
beer me

86
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:25,271
Beer me for always

87
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,503
That's the way it should be

88
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,102
Hey, you,

89
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:30,760
beer me

90
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,853
Beer us together

91
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:34,472
naturally.

92
00:04:34,596 --> 00:04:36,912
Now make everyword "beer."

93
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:39,242
Beer, beer

94
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:41,280
Beer, beer

95
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:43,900
Beer, beer,beer, beer, beer.

96
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:46,380
Wait, I forgot the words.

97
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:55,341
Love you.

98
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:57,833
No!

99
00:04:57,837 --> 00:04:58,903
If I leave the plane,

100
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:01,082
I'll be just like everyone else!

101
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:06,441
Ground control, this is November 543 Charlie.

102
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:08,171
We're going to need the extractor.

103
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:18,230
No!

104
00:05:19,157 --> 00:05:20,102
Oh...

105
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,071
I want to be back on the plane.

106
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:24,002
We'll be back before you know it.

107
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:24,993
Wha...

108
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:27,093
Svetlana! Svetlana!

109
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:30,622
Oh, hush.

110
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:33,512
Now let's enjoy the Miami of Canada--

111
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:34,710
Chicago!

112
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:39,270
<i>My kind of town</i>

113
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:41,723
<i>Chicago is</i>

114
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:44,072
<i>One town</i>

115
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:47,033
<i>That'll never, ever let you down</i>

116
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,610
<i>It's my...</i>

117
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:52,353
<i>Kind of town.</i>

118
00:05:52,406 --> 00:05:54,152
Okay, folks,for our first improv,

119
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:55,820
we're going to need an occupation.

120
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:56,713
Billionaire!

121
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:58,680
Nice job-- where do I apply?

122
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,202
Now I need a location.

123
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:02,402
I came to relax.

124
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:03,263
You think of it.

125
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:05,141
I heard"a Starbucks...

126
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,453
in Siberia."

127
00:06:06,455 --> 00:06:08,311
- Oh...
- Killer premise.

128
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:09,881
Finally an emotion.

129
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:10,673
Drunk!

130
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:12,540
Okay, "drunk."

131
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:15,020
And now we take you to a drunken billionaire

132
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:17,493
at a Starbucks in Siberia.

133
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:22,081
Uh, excuse me

134
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:23,331
I need a,

135
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:24,753
I need a coffee.

136
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:27,263
Can you change
a billion-dollar bill?

137
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:29,742
Our coffee costs a billion dollars.

138
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:31,590
This is Starbucks.

139
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,323
In Siberia.

140
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,861
Why are you applauding them?

141
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:38,872
We wrote it.

142
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:45,742
While you were here,we felt like New York.

143
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:51,080
I'm so happy!

144
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:03,416
Homer, you smell like Chicago.

145
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:05,773
Did you fly there on a commercial airline?

146
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,666
No way. Commercial is for losers and terrorists.

147
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,642
I flew on a private plane.

148
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:13,920
Is it much different from a normal plane?

149
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:16,020
Please, tell me you're joking.

150
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:17,841
It's the difference between champagne

151
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:19,382
and carbonated pee.

152
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:21,541
Homie, what's wrong?

153
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:23,391
I had it all for one night.

154
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:24,891
Now for the rest of my life,

155
00:07:24,897 --> 00:07:26,111
I'll know what I'm missing,

156
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,682
and all I have to remember it by

157
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:29,373
is that my ears haven't popped.

158
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:32,352
Well, I'll make sure that I never yawn again.

159
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,162
Hey, Homer.

160
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:36,053
D'oh!

161
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:44,552
Hi, Dad.

162
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,201
Hi.

163
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:47,440
High like a private plane?

164
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:50,340
The kind I'll never be invited to ride on again.

165
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:52,963
That's where you're wrong, Homer.

166
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,942
A fresh face!

167
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,521
This is Colby Krause.

168
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:59,153
I hired him to help you improve your life.

169
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:02,060
He'll get you back on a private plane in no time.

170
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:03,191
No way.

171
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:05,590
I don't need any shrink,therapist,

172
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:08,740
counselor, motivation all speaker or "guru."

173
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:10,112
I'm a life coach.

174
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,353
Oh, tell me more.

175
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,350
The first step in self-improvement

176
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:15,490
is to take a thorough look at your life.

177
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:18,362
If you're gonna film me,
I insist on a body double.

178
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,372
Is Uncle Fester still alive?

179
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:21,591
The camera's not on yet, right?

180
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:22,021
No.

181
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:23,611
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

182
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:25,561
Okay,

183
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:27,563
now I just want you to do

184
00:08:27,568 --> 00:08:29,481
what you normally do.

185
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:30,313
Okay.

186
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:34,451
hmm, I'll just, uh...

187
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:36,473
I forget what I do.

188
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:37,792
Wait, what?

189
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:40,940
This is some of what I do...

190
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:42,003
I think.

191
00:08:42,218 --> 00:08:43,931
Sometimes I go places.

192
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:46,932
This is our relish tray.

193
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:48,991
I'd like you to film it for insurance purposes.

194
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:51,890
Oh, what's the point of putting my socks on?

195
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:55,063
I just have to take them off again a week later.

196
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:57,852
Homer, before you even head
out the door in the morning,

197
00:08:57,856 --> 00:09:00,201
you're already a loser.

198
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:03,100
Fine, I'll show you a winner, just you watch.

199
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:09,041
Think positive, think positive.

200
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:15,430
You were saying?

201
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:19,073
Homer, your journey downstairs would've been a lot safer

202
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:20,000
if you'd remembered

203
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:22,320
the NDCs of concentration:

204
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:24,273
Never Don't Concentrate.

205
00:09:24,318 --> 00:09:25,580
Will you shut up?

206
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:27,232
I can't hear the song in my head!

207
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:31,163
Do you want to get a reaction shot of his butt?

208
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:33,291
No, but we should get some background noise.

209
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:35,862
Everyone quiet for four seconds.

210
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:41,611
Thank you, people.Moving on.

211
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,093
Here's an important tip:

212
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:50,263
Stop doing that.

213
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:56,070
I really enjoyed paying you to yell at me

214
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,353
and say I suck,but it's no use.

215
00:09:58,357 --> 00:10:00,713
I'm a hopeless loser and always will be.

216
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,971
- Homer, you're up!
- This I can do!

217
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,813
Yeah! Wow!

218
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:18,900
- Boom!
- Way to go!

219
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:22,303
Behold my 217 average and weep.

220
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,500
As I said, I've lost all hope.

221
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:28,920
Homer, here in the bowling alley,
you're a totally different man.

222
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:32,703
- Relaxed, confident...
- Is this going somewhere?

223
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,060
What we have to do
is figure a way to make

224
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:38,500
"Bowling Alley Homer"
into "Everyday Homer."

225
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:40,292
I have an aunt
who became an uncle.

226
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:41,602
Is it like that?

227
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,870
I want you to wear
those bowling shoes

228
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:48,052
out the door and
everywhere you go.

229
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:50,773
It's crazy, but it just might work.

230
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:54,310
Dr. Fredrick J. Waxman,
you're a genius!

231
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:55,643
That's not my name.

232
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:56,970
I wasn't talking to you.

233
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:06,721
<i>I'm the man</i>

234
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:01,051
<i>I spell "M"</i>

235
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:04,761
<i>"A" "N"</i>

236
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:06,722
<i>Man...</i>

237
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:13,170
Homer, your shoe attitude
is bowling people over.

238
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:16,563
These are letters from companies
interested in interviewing you.

239
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:18,502
How many of those
have private planes?

240
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,673
This one.

241
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:23,212
"Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing"?

242
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,933
They need a safety inspector to fly
between their North American plants.

243
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,483
I'm getting that job.

244
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,981
Bart, I'll need some clean urine.
Stat.

245
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:34,522
Now to make sure you're
motivated to get this job,

246
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:35,900
you have to quit your old one.

247
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,480
I'll call your boss right now.

248
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:42,710
I'll get it, sir.

249
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:44,440
Just send it to voice mail.

250
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,461
You here for the
safety inspector job?

251
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:56,400
Well, I can see the position of
hand somest CEO is already taken.

252
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:57,833
I like you already.

253
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:00,461
If you can write your name
so I can read it, you're in.

254
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:04,833
I got the job!

255
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:07,861
- Yay, Dad!
- We knew you could do it!

256
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:18,122
Good luck on your first day, Dad.

257
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:19,260
Give 'em hell, Homer.

258
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:23,023
We're all so proud of you, sweetie.

259
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:25,973
I'm gonna get there early,

260
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:28,532
so I can get in good
with the lunch truck guy.

261
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,340
Find out if he has a wife!
We could double date!

262
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,430
- Yay, Dad.
- You're our hero.

263
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:49,293
Can I help you?

264
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:52,333
Uh, yeah. I have no
job and nowhere to go.

265
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:55,233
What do I have to buy
so I can sit here all day?

266
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:58,143
Well, with a coffee,
you can stay till lunch.

267
00:12:58,295 --> 00:13:00,093
Then you have to order a solid.

268
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:01,970
One small coffee, please.

269
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:04,923
And a dozen of those
placemats with the maze on it.

270
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:06,920
They're all the same maze.

271
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,363
Somebody's got to do 'em.

272
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:43,810
Look happy.

273
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:51,631
So, how was your first day
at your new job?

274
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:53,261
Oh, it was great!

275
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:55,122
Flew to Tulsa on the company jet.

276
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:58,421
Did my job in a way consistent
with what I already told you.

277
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:00,383
Because that's what you do.

278
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:01,952
When you have a job.

279
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:03,533
I'm so proud of you, Dad!

280
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:05,813
Stop peppering me with questions!

281
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:09,192
Principal Skinner,

282
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:13,372
why did we have to leave the Learn
and Touch Reptile Zoo so early?

283
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:17,510
Well, it seems someone was riding
the giant tortoise naked.

284
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:18,772
It's not my fault.

285
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:20,861
The drinking fountain
dared me to do it.

286
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:25,693
Hmm? Freak fry!

287
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:28,960
Look out!
If it touches you, you die of suicide!

288
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:31,462
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

289
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:36,552
Dad?

290
00:14:45,195 --> 00:14:46,672
I know it's you, Homer.

291
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,681
Why aren't you at your new job?

292
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:56,322
Well, explanation-wise,
the fact is that...

293
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,462
I lied.
I didn't get the job.

294
00:14:58,718 --> 00:14:59,892
You see when I got there...

295
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:01,942
So, she said,

296
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:03,460
"That's not my in-box"

297
00:15:03,608 --> 00:15:06,550
and he said,
"That's not the Johnson Report!"

298
00:15:08,728 --> 00:15:12,043
You sure know how to repeat
the joke I just told ya.

299
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:16,233
But, as a formality, I must ask:

300
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:19,373
Do you know anything
about copper tubing?

301
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,313
Um... well, uh...

302
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:25,063
Come on, say
"You're hired"!

303
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,280
- No.
- Say it!

304
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:30,110
Leave your resume with Cheryl.

305
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:33,941
- Say it!
- Security! Security!

306
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:35,371
Stop saying "Security"!

307
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:37,961
Come on, just give me the job.

308
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:40,180
I like your hat.

309
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:43,330
- Just say the word.
- Cheryl.

310
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:48,473
I couldn't bear to tell your mother,
so I hang out here all day.

311
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,162
But, Dad, you gotta tell her.

312
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:52,490
She's been buying
brand-name groceries.

313
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:54,842
Brands like "Miser's Choice"
and "Day-Old Delights"?

314
00:15:55,227 --> 00:15:58,711
No, things rich people buy,
like Campbell's Soup and Pepsodent.

315
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:06,983
Hello?

316
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:10,040
Honey, there's something
I have to tell you.

317
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,611
It's bad news, isn't it?

318
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:13,452
I should never get my hopes up.

319
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,541
Nothing ever works out for us.

320
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,470
No, it's, uh...
good news!

321
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:19,700
Really?

322
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:23,661
We're manufacturing
a new pipe diameter,

323
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:24,782
five-eighths inch.

324
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,760
The company wants you and me

325
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:30,311
to take the private plane
to New York for the premiere!

326
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:32,961
So meet me at Shelbyville
Airport in an hour.

327
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:35,383
If I'm gonna tell
that woman the truth,

328
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:38,462
I'm going to do it in the one place
no one can ever be sad.

329
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:43,182
Okay, so this should be enough
money to get me up in the air,

330
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,561
have a frank talk with Marge
then maybe eat a deviled egg.

331
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:48,313
Well, anything,
for a fellow Marine.

332
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,180
Yeah, semper fudge!

333
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,611
Uh, did you just say
"Semper fudge"?

334
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:53,833
No, I said the right thing.

335
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:56,792
Look at this business center.

336
00:16:56,966 --> 00:17:00,711
Fax, Wi-Fi,
teleconferencing capabilities.

337
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:04,740
I'm gonna remember this day
for the rest of my life!

338
00:17:05,086 --> 00:17:06,411
Uh, honey...

339
00:17:07,045 --> 00:17:09,563
don't try to remember
the whole day.

340
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:11,392
Just what you're
feeling this second.

341
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,513
Sweetheart, what do you mean?

342
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:15,883
Marge, I gotta be honest...

343
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:18,291
- What was that?
- I don't know.

344
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:19,982
Maybe we flew through a rainbow.

345
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,631
I didn't think I'd be flying
today so I was doing heroin.

346
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,432
Homie, what are you doing?

347
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:34,911
You don't know how to fly!

348
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:37,653
I drove a car over a cliff once.
How different could it be?

349
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:41,302
What's the ocean doing
in the sky?

350
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:48,402
There's only one man
who can help us now.

351
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,883
Hello, and welcome to success.

352
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:52,102
It's Marge Simpson.

353
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:55,050
I need you to coach like
you've never coached before!

354
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:56,552
Marge, please, I'm with a client.

355
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:00,261
Now you listen here, bub!

356
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:03,102
We paid you all the savings
we had in the world.

357
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:06,202
You could at least tell my
husband something encouraging.

358
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:08,662
All right, Homer.
What is it you're attempting to do?

359
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:10,163
Win over a difficult client?

360
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:12,382
I'm trying to land a plane
with no experience.

361
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:15,773
Homer, I gotta tell you
I'm not very good.

362
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,530
I went to the Harvard of the South.

363
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:18,883
Duke? That's good.

364
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:20,581
- Not Duke.
- Vanderbilt?

365
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:21,873
A little further south.

366
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:23,550
Don't make me say it.

367
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:29,880
Duffman has reported you
to the FAA.

368
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:32,360
This near miss will be
investigated

369
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:35,152
by a board of three retired pilots.

370
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:36,913
Okay, Homer.

371
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:39,703
I don't know anything about planes,
but I know about you.

372
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:42,280
You have what made America great:

373
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:45,273
no understanding of the limits
of your power,

374
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,500
and a complete lack of concern
for what anyone thinks of you.

375
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:50,300
So you'll land that plane.

376
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:51,712
And do you know why?

377
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,351
Because I heard some guy say
you couldn't.

378
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:58,240
What? I'll show him.
I'll show that guy!

379
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:05,920
Elevation 300 feet,
200 feet, 50 feet...

380
00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:12,161
Homer, you did it!

381
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:13,641
You landed a jet!

382
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,120
And now, to taxi to the terminal.

383
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:20,421
D'oh!

384
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:29,010
Marge, flying in private jets
is great and all,

385
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:30,941
but it's just too dangerous.

386
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:33,782
That's why I've decided
to go to the plant

387
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:36,343
and beg Mr. Burns
for my old job back.

388
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,351
I understand, Homie.

389
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:40,312
And at least we can take

390
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:42,541
the extra income you've earned
in the last few months

391
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:44,550
and set it aside for a rainy day.

392
00:19:44,698 --> 00:19:46,333
You'd think so, but no.

393
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:50,922
Mr. Richie, your American Music
Awards are weighing us down!

394
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:52,290
Let them go!

395
00:19:52,518 --> 00:19:54,720
- You let yours go!
- I don't have any.

396
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:56,252
That's right, you don't!

397
00:19:58,088 --> 00:20:00,301
