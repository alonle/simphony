1
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,259
Okay, Maggie.

2
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,840
Say your "good nights."

3
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:33,887
Good night, Teddy Bear.

4
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:36,026
Good night, Justin Timberwolf.

5
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:38,481
Good night, Bedtime Krusty.

6
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:40,568
Don't let the bedbugs bite!

7
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:43,013
Krusty's Anti-Bedbug Spray
sold separately.

8
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:44,188
May contain poison.

9
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:46,536
Good night, Maggie.

10
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:50,970
Come on, sweetie.

11
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:52,826
Everyone's going to sleep.

12
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:54,373
You know you make me wanna

13
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:54,826
Shout!

14
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:56,093
Throw my hands up and

15
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:56,592
Shout!

16
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:57,922
Kick my heels up and

17
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:58,663
Shout!

18
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:03,950
A little bit louder now

19
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:05,663
A little bit louder now

20
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:15,840
All right,

21
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,900
I'll make you another bottle.

22
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:22,643
Maggie's so clingy.

23
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:24,580
Homer, hold her
while I pour the milk.

24
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:25,920
No problem.

25
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:29,030
My, you've grown.

26
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:38,213
Wha...?!

27
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:39,843
Spilled milk?

28
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:47,091
All over the floor.

29
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,483
Hey, Apu,

30
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,761
what happened
to all your milk?

31
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:54,313
I sold it all to teenagers.

32
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:56,100
There's a rumor you
can mix milk,

33
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:58,123
Mentos and Lotto scrapings

34
00:01:58,126 --> 00:01:59,483
to make jetpack fuel.

35
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,171
Does it work?

36
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:01,072
Kinda.

37
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:06,200
Hey, Moe!

38
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:06,972
Got any milk?

39
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,941
It's either milk or paint.

40
00:02:12,815 --> 00:02:14,193
It's paint.

41
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:15,660
Or is it?

42
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:18,900
Yeah, it's paint.

43
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:20,401
Well, then I'll have
to charge you extra,

44
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,550
depending on the color.

45
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:22,871
Uh, stick out your tongue.

46
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:23,912
Eggshell?

47
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:24,512
No.

48
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:26,222
Malabar ivory?

49
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:26,803
No.

50
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:28,443
Mediterranean ecru?

51
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:29,250
No.

52
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:30,643
Ah! Here it is...

53
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:31,283
white.

54
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:34,262
Ooh, that's gonna cost ya.

55
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,140
There must be a Web site

56
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:37,093
that can help you deal

57
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:38,130
with a clingy baby.

58
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:39,212
Oh, I don't want to bother

59
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:40,833
the Internet with my problem.

60
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:41,702
Aw, come on, Mom.

61
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,742
We'll help you surf.

62
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:44,370
Click that one, Mom.

63
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:44,910
No, go up.

64
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:45,240
Keep going

65
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:45,633
up, up, up!

66
00:02:45,637 --> 00:02:46,473
The blue ones are ads.

67
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:47,260
That's the toolbar.

68
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,313
Now you've opened Word;

69
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:48,812
close it.

70
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:50,433
Close it. Do-Don't save it.

71
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:51,152
Stop clicking.

72
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:51,740
Don't go there!

73
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:53,103
Why are you
buying a freezer?

74
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,763
Don't click the cart
or you've bought it!

75
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:56,863
Aw, you clicked
the cart.

76
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:59,401
If you're so smart, you do it.

77
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:05,370
C.R.I.E?

78
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:06,713
What does that stand for?

79
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:09,853
"Creative Responses
for Infant Edu-loving!"

80
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,693
Ooh, "edu-loving!"

81
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:13,170
They come to your home to help

82
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:14,422
you raise "independent,

83
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:16,213
self-actualized children."

84
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:17,533
"The counselors can come

85
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:18,683
day and night because

86
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:20,500
they have no families
themselves."

87
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:22,291
Okay, I'll sign up.

88
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:24,100
You just bought
another freezer.

89
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:25,983
Well, maybe I wanted
another freezer!

90
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:28,452
I've got to find milk somewhere.

91
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:48,860
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

92
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:52,013
<i>On the dark side</i>

93
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:54,403
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

94
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:03,743
<i>Oh... yeah!</i>

95
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:06,591
You want milk?!

96
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:08,770
I got your milk right here.

97
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,580
At first I thought you were
pointing to your crouch.

98
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,551
You thought, huh?

99
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:16,520
Yo, everybody!

100
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,612
Get a load of "Beautiful Mind" over here,

101
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:19,540
with the thinkin'.

102
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:22,881
Listen up, ya humps!

103
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,863
Which one of youz
parked at the bank?

104
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:27,452
'Cause they're towing
your sorry ass.

105
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:30,072
That's my car!

106
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:32,323
Yo, Angelica.

107
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:33,143
Get over here.

108
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:39,210
This don't mean nothing.

109
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,743
Ah, please! Give me a break!

110
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:44,700
I've been driving all night,

111
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:46,331
looking for milk for my kids.

112
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:47,912
I'll tell you what.

113
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:49,803
I'll give you a ride to
the impound lot.

114
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:51,912
Okay, let me just grab
my registration.

115
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:03,210
I can't believe your
boss lets you listen

116
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:05,220
to rock music while you work.

117
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:06,471
My boss?

118
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:09,272
I don't think my boss has

119
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,751
a problem with anything I do.

120
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:13,191
Oh, I'd really like to meet this guy.

121
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:15,182
Well, he's in this truck right now.

122
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,522
But it's just you and me.

123
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:22,640
That must mean...

124
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:24,043
I'm your boss!

125
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:25,931
I'm sick of you!
You're fired!

126
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:27,340
No, you dumb Dominick.

127
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm my own boss.

128
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:29,903
Shut up!

129
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:32,232
When you call in sick,
who do you call?

130
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:35,102
I don't call in sick.
I work when I want to.

131
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:36,971
Sometimes you want to work?

132
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:39,610
Hey, I get to drive around,
eat what I want,

133
00:05:39,616 --> 00:05:41,252
eyeball the highway honeys...

134
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:44,121
I'm your aunt, stupid!

135
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:45,650
...and lasso the street cattle.

136
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:46,581
Street cattle?

137
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,533
The cars I tow,

138
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:49,240
I got all kinds of names for them:

139
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:51,163
She-atas, Hebrew canoes,

140
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,430
spam cans,Swedish speedballs,

141
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,620
and of course,stretch lame-os.

142
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:57,261
Some of those were pretty funny.

143
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:00,470
Check it out.

144
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:02,136
We already got a "whine line."

145
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:03,563
When can I get my Beamer?

146
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,566
I can't be out in this neighborhood!

147
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,981
My jewelry's real!

148
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:08,570
You can't tow a hybrid.

149
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:11,451
My blow better still be in the glove box.

150
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,230
Wow, you make people miserable

151
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:15,023
anthere's nothing they can do about it!

152
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,492
Just like God.

153
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:19,963
Man, oh, man, you got the greatest job in the world.

154
00:06:21,368 --> 00:06:23,213
You know, if you're interested,

155
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:25,000
we could use another hook jockey.

156
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,911
The Springfield territory's wide open,

157
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,831
since Flatbed Fred got killed

158
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:30,870
in that murder-murder-murder-suicide.

159
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:32,251
I would love to!

160
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,772
Oh, but I don't have a tow truck.

161
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:37,230
For 500 bucks, I'll sell you this old bucket.

162
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:41,460
Hmm... I'm not sure my wife will go
for this naughty mud flaps.

163
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:43,923
Not to worry. These...

164
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,483
are the ones you show at home.

165
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:48,080
That's still too sexy for my wife.

166
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:48,951
No problem.

167
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:54,022
Man, you work as a silhouette model for one day

168
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:56,041
and it haunts you for the rest of your life.

169
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:57,683
Now just remember two rules.

170
00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:59,733
One, stick to Springfield.

171
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:01,113
If I catch you on my turf,

172
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:02,192
I'll rip off your head,

173
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:03,171
vomit down your neck,

174
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:04,093
pull out your heart,

175
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:04,981
show it to your head,

176
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:06,952
then shove 'em both down your neck hole,

177
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:08,483
to which I previously alluded.

178
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:10,261
"...which I previously alluded..."

179
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:11,731
Are there two "L's" in "alluded"?

180
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:12,601
Rule number two,

181
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:14,242
always keep your hook pointed out.

182
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:16,392
Why? What happens if I point it this way?

183
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:17,630
Oh hello-o!

184
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,361
Hello! Hello, Captain Hook!

185
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:22,551
Oh, spoil sport.

186
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:23,733
Oh, you're no fun.

187
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,031
Ah, my first tow.

188
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:37,781
I think it goes... here.

189
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:43,392
D'oh!

190
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:48,103
Ah, my first tow.

191
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,502
Stop. Stop.

192
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,141
I'm entitled to park there.

193
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:57,370
Really? What's your handicap?

194
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,470
Pogonophobia--fear of beards and mustaches.

195
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:06,160
Well, I guess I can call a cab.

196
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:09,692
Stay back! All of ya!

197
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:23,360
Faster!

198
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:25,050
More dangerous!

199
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:41,180
Marge, your code pendent hyper-nurturing

200
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:42,922
has infantilized your baby.

201
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,920
You've made her queen of her "clingdom."

202
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:46,912
Ooh, did you hearthat, Maggie-wags?

203
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:48,332
You're a queen.

204
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:50,132
Marge, you're reinforcing a negative.

205
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,072
I'm what?

206
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:53,103
Allow me to demonstri-care.

207
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:55,321
Actualize!

208
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:02,700
And now you are free
to live like a human being.

209
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:08,381
Maggie's crying.

210
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:09,492
She's not crying,

211
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:11,302
She's celebrating her independence.

212
00:09:11,307 --> 00:09:12,693
Don't crash that party.

213
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:15,230
Oh... one hug can't hurt.

214
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:17,313
Yes, it can-- hugs are drugs,

215
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:18,640
and your daughter's an addict.

216
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:23,611
I guess it's time to let
my little girl grow up.

217
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:29,711
You see?

218
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:32,883
Now her childhood can begin-ualize.

219
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:35,610
Huh. Thank you, CRIE.

220
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:38,431
I'm, huh, I'm sorry about the kick.

221
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:40,703
I've never done anything
like that before.

222
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:43,663
Yeah, well, I'm glad your first
time was such a success.

223
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:48,043
What the hell are you doing?

224
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,572
I'm doing my job.

225
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:51,330
You're hovering over a hydrant.

226
00:09:57,316 --> 00:09:58,851
You're in the sky now--

227
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:00,311
my domain.

228
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:13,740
I've got tow dough

229
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,211
I'm looking
to blow, Moe.

230
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:15,661
Huh?

231
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:18,663
I'm buying a round of the
fanciest drink you got.

232
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,983
Four "Lobster-politans" comin' up.

233
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,761
Here's to Homer and the cars he towed.

234
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:36,172
With those jerks out of the way,

235
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,022
I was able to park right outside.

236
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:38,750
Outside?

237
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,301
That's a one-hour parking zone,

238
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:41,930
and you've been here a good 81 minutes.

239
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:44,632
Correction: a great 81 minutes.

240
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:47,192
'Cause nothing beats hangin' around with old friends,

241
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:49,822
drinkin' lobster-based designer drinks and...

242
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:53,653
Huh, good joke, Homer.

243
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:55,832
You can unhook my car now.

244
00:10:57,626 --> 00:10:59,191
Uh, looks like he's driving away with it.

245
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:03,001
No, he's just moving it so it won't get towed.

246
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:23,111
Maggie, what can I get you for breakf...?

247
00:11:24,646 --> 00:11:26,373
You did everything yourself.

248
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:29,522
Homer, where have you been?

249
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,190
Marge, when you're married
to a midnight towboy,

250
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:34,150
you might not see him
for days on end.

251
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:35,840
I don't want to live like that.

252
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,902
Hey, when you married a man
who would, years later,

253
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:41,212
without warning, become
a tow truck driver,

254
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:43,730
you knew what the deal
would eventually be.

255
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,841
Well, no one's disputing that.

256
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:46,910
Guess what, boy?

257
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:49,530
Last night I towed
your principal's car.

258
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,870
Oh, awesome.
How's he getting around?

259
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:57,323
You can't impound my spirit.

260
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:03,600
Top of the mornin', Tow-mer.

261
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:05,891
It's Homer, idiot.

262
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,362
So it is.

263
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:10,011
I'm just here to pay the fine
for the Sunday School bus.

264
00:12:10,217 --> 00:12:11,952
You towed it
with the kids still in it.

265
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:16,253
I guess I'm more powerful
than God now.

266
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:17,301
You know what they say:

267
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:19,882
"With great power comes
great responsibility."

268
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:20,983
Who said that?!

269
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:22,782
I'll kill them with my power.

270
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:28,213
Take that, you tow-talitarian.

271
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,712
Doesn't that joke make
light of totalitarians?

272
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:34,872
Stalin put my grandmother
in a forced labor camp for 20 years.

273
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:36,861
Look, I was insensitive,
and I'm sorry.

274
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:39,410
But what this is really about
is a bully with a winch.

275
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:42,762
If I'd wanted the laws of this
town enforced to the letter,

276
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:45,272
I wouldn't have hired fatty here
as police chief.

277
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:47,682
Hear that, Ralphie?
The mayor knows daddy.

278
00:12:48,597 --> 00:12:49,801
All right, listen up.

279
00:12:50,057 --> 00:12:52,283
I know a thing or two
about tow-Joes.

280
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:55,461
I married three of them,
and they're real territorial.

281
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,012
Now here's the plan...

282
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:00,580
Get in here, Mel.
I don't bite.

283
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:02,823
I might gum ya,
and you might like it.

284
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:18,211
Must we all wait
behind this bush?

285
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:19,713
I have theater tickets.

286
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:20,942
Theater tickets, huh?

287
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:22,552
Now ya got nothin'.

288
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:40,883
Maggie's completely independent.

289
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:44,540
At least you need me,
sack of potatoes.

290
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:04,602
Oh, my God...

291
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:07,903
multiple tickets,
handicapped spot,

292
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:11,471
parked by a hydrant,
incomprehensible vanity plate.

293
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:15,253
If my life as a tow truck driver
were a teleplay,

294
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:17,422
this would be the end of act two.

295
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:30,131
I told you to stay off my turf!

296
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:32,172
What? I'm still in Springfield.

297
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:36,021
Wha...?!

298
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,701
Okay, I made a mistake.

299
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,572
Why don't you give me
two demerit points

300
00:14:39,686 --> 00:14:41,652
in a point system
we work out right now?

301
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:51,901
Put me down, you lousy--

302
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,051
Okay, I'm warning you--

303
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,633
I'll kill you, you son of a--

304
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:02,852
All right buddy,
that's it, I've had--

305
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:14,201
You... let go!

306
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:18,432
All right, Just... let... go.

307
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,413
Oh, a trap door.
What's down there?

308
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:24,742
Your Meatball collection?

309
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,292
- Good-bye.
- I thought we were friends!

310
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:28,161
I was kidding you
in a friendly fashion!

311
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:32,963
Who are you guys?

312
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,161
We're just like you.

313
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,382
Tow truck drivers who got greedy.

314
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:38,832
Is Louie keeping you prisoner here?

315
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:42,312
No. We're waiting for him
to give us a timesha representation.

316
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:44,351
Actually,
we're an a cappella group

317
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:46,301
and we're gonna sing
"Under the BoardWalk."

318
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:49,031
The truth is, we're just waiting
for each others' hair to grow

319
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:50,210
so we can braid it.

320
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:53,862
Okay, I get it.
I'm not stupid.

321
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,302
It's number two, right?

322
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:59,401
<i>Under the boardwalk</i>

323
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:04,800
<i>Down by the sea</i>

324
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:11,680
<i>On a blanket with my baby
That's where I'll be</i>

325
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:14,502
<i>Under the boardwalk</i>

326
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,660
<i>Out of the sun!</i>

327
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:19,500
It sure is great not
having Homer around

328
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:21,462
to tell us where we
can or can't park.

329
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,630
Yeah, without the crushing
rule of law,

330
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:26,180
society will do a better job
of regulating itself.

331
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:36,032
Of all the nerve!

332
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:47,482
Now to buy some soft luggage.

333
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,210
Dad?
Where are you?

334
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,303
Do not worry.
I am working.

335
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:57,790
Working?
Where?

336
00:16:58,028 --> 00:16:59,280
Ask no questions.

337
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:02,070
And do not call the police,
or I will kill me.

338
00:17:02,257 --> 00:17:03,292
You sound weird.

339
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,251
All is well.
Good-bye forever.

340
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:09,391
Get out of the way!

341
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:10,602
That's my space.

342
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:11,910
I was here first.

343
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:16,543
Avast, ye sky whale!

344
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:29,271
I need a camera battery!

345
00:17:38,206 --> 00:17:42,740
All the Transformers transformed
back into trucks and cars.

346
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,062
The end.

347
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:45,520
- That's great.
- Great story.

348
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,220
Okay, we've got time
for one more.

349
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:48,780
Oh, yeah. All right.

350
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,061
Once upon a time,

351
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:53,171
there was a hilarious ogre
named Shrek Three.

352
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:54,901
He lived in medieval times,

353
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:58,021
but sometimes he'd say things
from today times...

354
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:01,240
Got one!

355
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:08,192
We can say these swears
any time we want

356
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:09,323
because they're
in the Bible!

357
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,371
I don't think "Leviticus"
is a swear.

358
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:13,183
Shut the hell up,
you damn ass whore.

359
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:14,091
Bart?

360
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:18,031
I'm starting to worry
about your father.

361
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:20,442
Well, I know he seems
to get dumber every year,

362
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:21,730
but lately he's plateaued.

363
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:24,263
He hasn't been home in four days.

364
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:27,250
Well, I guess he told me
not to worry.

365
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:30,681
Where are you, Homie?

366
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:16,581
Yah, yah, doggies!

367
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:41,643
And if elected president
of our small community,

368
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:47,132
I will determine once and for all
how far we can go without being gay.

369
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:52,050
Maggie!

370
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:09,112
We're free!

371
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:11,903
Maggie!

372
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:13,510
You did all this?!

373
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:18,411
And to pay you back,
I'm returning your nose.

374
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:19,981
Here's your nose.

375
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,612
Daddy's putting back your nose.

376
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:25,050
That's your--Oh, wait.
That's Lisa's nose.

377
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,102
Homie!

378
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:29,321
You're all right!

379
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:32,371
Thanks to her!

380
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:35,423
Really?

381
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:36,723
Look at you...

382
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:38,412
so grown up.

383
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:41,222
Well, I've moved on, too.

384
00:20:51,978 --> 00:20:53,003

385
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:54,402
