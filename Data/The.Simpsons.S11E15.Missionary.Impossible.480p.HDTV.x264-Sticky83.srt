1
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:03,425
<i> Okay, here we go.</i>
<i>Christine's first report card.</i>

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:05,378
<i>- Lay it on me.</i>
<i>- In math,</i>

3
00:00:05,478 --> 00:00:08,513
her teacher gave
her an E-plus.

4
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:10,148
Wait a second,
I don't know what that means.

5
00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:11,549
It's, like, one step up
from an "F."

6
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:12,750
That's bad.

7
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:14,418
No, "E," in this case,
stands for "exemplary."

8
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:16,354
It's the highest
possible grade.

9
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:19,724
Of course it does.
And it's E-plus, too, huh?

10
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:21,759
She also got an E-plus
in physical education.

11
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:23,394
That is something
I never achieved.

12
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:24,695
Lightning-quick reflexes.

13
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:26,864
Just like her dad, huh?

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,099
Fast like a flea.

15
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:29,834
Aw, you remembered.
Yeah, okay.

16
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:31,169
What about spelling?
I was horrible at spelling.

17
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:32,537
Thank God for computers,
'cause I, you know,

18
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:33,638
I couldn't even spell
the word "spelling."

19
00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:35,506
Well, that's
just sad, Booth.

20
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:36,707
That's a joke.

21
00:00:36,743 --> 00:00:38,342
Okay? Come on, what'd she get?

22
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:39,911
E-plus.

23
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:41,245
E-plus!

24
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:42,947
Actually, she got perfect
grades across the board.

25
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:44,549
This calls for a celebration.

26
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:46,751
Taking her out for
ice cream after dinner.

27
00:00:46,786 --> 00:00:48,486
What is it?
A body was found in the Potomac.

28
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:50,721
It's being brought to the lab.
Well, that's not good,

29
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:52,423
because that means
the local PD moved the victim

30
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,725
from the crime scene, and I know
how much you hate that.

31
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:56,127
I do.

32
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:59,430
However, I'm not going to
allow this minor irritation

33
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:01,599
to get in the way
of my excellent mood.

34
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:05,036
I mean, our daughter
is a genius.

35
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:07,672
E-plus.

36
00:01:10,944 --> 00:01:13,177
Two frat guys from Georgetown

37
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:15,613
found the body while
attempting a polar bear plunge

38
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:17,048
in the Potomac.

39
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,549
From what I can see
of the remaining tissue,

40
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:20,785
the victim was
a Caucasian male.

41
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,753
Big, too, at least
six feet tall.

42
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:24,755
Yeah, well, the
facial reconstruction

43
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,225
is gonna be a bit tough
without the mandible.

44
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,728
Whoa-ho-ho, nice bracelet.

45
00:01:30,763 --> 00:01:32,530
I'm not sure who's got
more ice on them,

46
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:33,831
you or the victim.

47
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,867
Uh, the victim, obviously.

48
00:01:35,902 --> 00:01:37,535
You like it?
I got it for Angie

49
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,203
as a desperate attempt
to apologize

50
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,972
for what a jerk
I've been recently.

51
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:42,540
It wasn't necessary.

52
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:44,675
You've... you've been through a lot.
I know,

53
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:46,911
but I just want you to know

54
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:48,279
that I'm trying and...

55
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:49,547
and I love you very much.

56
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:51,749
Okay, enough of
the lovey-dovey.

57
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:53,251
Honestly, I found you guys
more bearable

58
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:54,952
when you were unbearable.

59
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:56,487
Well, I for one,

60
00:01:56,522 --> 00:01:58,623
am glad to see you more like
your old self again.

61
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:01,092
Now it's just Dr. Brennan's mood
I have to worry about.

62
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:03,461
Yeah, uh, there's no
way she can do an examination

63
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,596
on a human Popsicle.

64
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:07,131
According to my calculations,

65
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,767
at room temperature,
without forced convection,

66
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:11,335
it should take approximately

67
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:14,305
eight hours and 33 minutes
for the ice to melt.

68
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,474
Brennan's not gonna
want to wait that long.

69
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,777
Actually, I think
I have an idea.

70
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:24,682
So what are you thinking?

71
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:26,217
Homicide?
Accidental drowning? Suicide?

72
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:27,518
Well, we don't know, Aubrey,

73
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:29,654
till we get stuff back
from the lab, right?

74
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:30,689
Here are the pictures.

75
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:32,189
Ah, there you are.
Finally.

76
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:33,225
Hello.

77
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:34,358
Karen, great.
Yeah.

78
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:35,626
Okay, what are you doing here?

79
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:37,094
Does the BRIU have
an interest in the case?

80
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,195
Oh, no, uh, actually,

81
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:40,031
I don't know what case
you're referring to,

82
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:41,666
but if you need my help.

83
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:44,869
No, actually, you know, it's
probably just a suicide, so...

84
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:46,070
Oh, really?

85
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:48,339
'Cause given the weather,
I don't think so.

86
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:50,207
She doesn't think so.
Obviously.

87
00:02:50,243 --> 00:02:54,145
No, see, suicide by drowning
decreases 72% in cold weather.

88
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,680
Behaviorally, we can't
control our reflex

89
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:57,281
to get out of icy water.

90
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:59,417
Unless you jump off the bridge,
and then you really don't

91
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,785
have a choice of getting out.

92
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,020
- Which bridge?
- Body was found in Rock Creek;

93
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:04,889
nearest bridge is
Theodore Roosevelt.

94
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:06,557
Oh, no.

95
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:08,259
See, the bridge of
choice for jumpers

96
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:11,028
is either the Duke Ellington
or the George Washington.

97
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:12,129
Besides, I mean,

98
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:13,397
look at this body.

99
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:14,632
Our victim's wearing a suit.

100
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:15,967
Looks nice, put together.

101
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,668
Nope. I think you've
got a body dump.

102
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:18,970
Okay, so that's great.

103
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:20,304
Thank you very much
for coming in.

104
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,173
If you don't have anything else
about the case, you can...

105
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,174
Oh, no, actually,

106
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,675
I-I came to see Agent Aubrey.

107
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:25,876
He's right here.

108
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:27,812
Me? Okay. What do you need?

109
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:29,947
Well, I have not had
my morning coffee yet,

110
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:32,183
and I thought maybe you
and I could go get some.

111
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:33,250
Together.

112
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:34,286
I already have coffee.

113
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,155
Well, maybe,
um, a rain check.

114
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:39,423
Tonight?

115
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,425
Excuse me?

116
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:44,061
She's asking you out on a date.

117
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:45,629
Mm-hmm. What do you say?

118
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:47,531
Oh.

119
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,667
I'm sorry, what?

120
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,574
What we've done is
we've hooked these vents up

121
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,109
to a metallurgical
blast furnace.

122
00:03:58,144 --> 00:03:59,543
I happened to have
one lying around

123
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,012
from a previous experiment.

124
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:02,480
Is this the same furnace
that almost

125
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:03,647
burned down the lab last year?

126
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:06,817
Uh, different circumstances,
but yes.

127
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:08,285
I call her Smaug,

128
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:10,187
because this baby breathes fire.

129
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:11,522
According to my calculations,

130
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:13,190
it should take approximately

131
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:15,192
15.2 seconds
for the ice to melt.

132
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:17,395
What about the water
and particulate evidence?

133
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,330
Yeah, there's
a 400-gallon basin

134
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:21,432
below the grates that's
catching every last drop.

135
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:23,634
Proceed.

136
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:27,772
T minus three.

137
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:29,006
Two.

138
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,307
One.

139
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:38,215
It's working!

140
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:41,552
Applied science is
a beautiful, beautiful thing!

141
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:02,273
I must say,
that is excellent work.

142
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:06,610
Ooh.

143
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:08,446
Well done, Dr. Hodgins.

144
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:10,815
You are king of the lab
once again.

It's like
you're rootering

150
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,290
a pair of lungs.
Yeah.

151
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:58,293
The interesting thing is,
I'm not seeing any river water.

152
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:00,061
No dinoflagellates
or micro-algae

153
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:01,496
in any of this lung tissue.

154
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:03,231
Well, that means, then,

155
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:05,133
that that behavioral
analyst was right,

156
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:07,302
that this was a body dump.

157
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:09,904
So I'm guess things are
better between you and Hodgins?

158
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,241
Oh, yeah, they are.

159
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:15,310
It's just this is
totally not me.

160
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:17,746
Well, it's totally me,
so no complaining.

161
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:20,682
Yeah, I appreciate
that he's trying.

162
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:23,818
It's just, it's not
like it was before.

163
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:25,353
We're not...

164
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:26,888
intimate.

165
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:28,957
Give it time.

166
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:31,860
I'm sure he'll engage with you
when he's ready.

167
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:34,329
And you'll be right there
when he does.

168
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:36,231
Thanks.

169
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:38,266
Oh.

170
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:40,835
Oh, hey, what about...
what about her?

171
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:42,170
Her?

172
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:43,404
Yeah, for an I.D.

173
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,173
I mean, if a guy gets

174
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,208
a tattoo of a woman's face
on his arm,

175
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:48,843
then she probably meant
something to him, right?

176
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,979
You want to run your facial
recognition software

177
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:52,213
on the tattoo?

178
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:53,281
If we can find her,

179
00:06:53,316 --> 00:06:55,717
then maybe she can
give us an I.D.

180
00:06:57,187 --> 00:06:59,320
<i>Okay, so when's the big date?</i>

181
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:01,222
There's not gonna
be any date.

182
00:07:01,258 --> 00:07:02,690
Mm, that's not
what I heard.

183
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,192
I heard you say "yes."

184
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:06,961
What was I supposed to say?
She blindsided me.

185
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:09,531
Who the hell asks someone out
in front of another person?

186
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:11,900
Well, you know, shrinks tend
to be a little bit crazy.

187
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:14,369
And you know what they say
about the crazy ones in bed.

188
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,337
No.

189
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:17,839
Look, things are going great
with me and Jessica.

190
00:07:17,874 --> 00:07:19,541
I don't want to
mess that up.

191
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:21,376
You got something?
Yeah.

192
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,511
Angela's sending me, uh, an I.D.
of the tattoo of this lady,

193
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:25,847
Lissa Bowman,
Bethesda, Maryland.

194
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:27,882
Lissa Bowman-- why does
that name sound familiar?

195
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:28,782
Huh, maybe you had
coffee with her.

196
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:29,518
Ooh.

197
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,019
You're good, you know that?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

198
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:32,454
All right, you mind
taking that one?

199
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:34,656
I'm gonna go, uh, sort out
this date thing with Karen.

200
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:35,924
No problem.

201
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,492
You better nip this
in the bud, huh?

202
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:40,562
Because, before you know it,
coffee turns into lunch,

203
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:42,363
and then lunch into dinner,

204
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,735
and then the candles
are burning low all night long.

205
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:53,808
Yeah, it's got to be Frankie.

206
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:56,544
He got that tattoo
when we were

207
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,613
vacationing down in
South Beach one year.

208
00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:00,982
That's also where I was born.
Really?

209
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:02,817
So when did you first notice
your husband went missing?

210
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,052
A week ago.

211
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:05,253
I didn't really
think much of it,

212
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:06,554
'cause he's often
out of town for work.

213
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,523
Mm-hmm. And what kind
of work did he do?

214
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:10,725
Frankie was what you
would call a fixer.

215
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,660
And his clients were
nothing but top-shelf.

216
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:14,762
Politicians and CEOs,
athletes.

217
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,998
He even had a handful
of movie stars.

218
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,566
Right, okay.

219
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:21,069
So his job was to use
whatever means necessary

220
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:24,572
to make sure his client's
problems went away.

221
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,708
Frankie always tried to keep me
safe by not telling me

222
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:27,942
too much about
what he was doing.

223
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:29,978
I just wish
Frankie had

224
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:32,146
taken such good care of himself.

225
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:33,848
I'm gonna need to talk
to somebody at his work.

226
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:34,884
You should talk to Kerry,

227
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:35,984
his assistant.

228
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,285
I'll get you her number.

229
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,453
Right.

230
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:39,654
Here you go.

231
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:41,422
Agent Booth,

232
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,459
you find who did this,
you hear me?

233
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:47,795
You find them,
and you make them pay.

234
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:53,835
Dr. Brennan.

235
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,303
In examining the cleaned skull,

236
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:56,905
I identified some perimortem
stellate fractures

237
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,641
to the alveolar process,
the maxilla

238
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:00,808
and the inferior nasal conchae.

239
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:02,110
Fractures which
are indicative

240
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:03,177
of blunt force trauma.

241
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:04,412
I believe cause of death

242
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,648
was due to
intracerebral hemorrhage.

243
00:09:06,683 --> 00:09:07,815
I concur.

244
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,117
Good work.

245
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:11,619
I see your daughter
did well.

246
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:13,288
Oh, yes.

247
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,056
We're very proud of her.

248
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,125
I, too, received nothing
but top marks at her age,

249
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,192
in every subject matter.

250
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:20,395
Of course,
standards were much higher

251
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,330
when I was in first grade.

252
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:25,566
A point of fact, I actually was
exemplary in all my subjects.

253
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:28,536
What do you mean
"standards were higher"?

254
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:30,905
Well, take this E-plus
Christine received in Art.

255
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:32,573
Look at that drawing.

256
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:34,509
The lines jitter.
The color palette

257
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:36,711
is either primary
or mud brown.

258
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:38,546
She hardly applied
any shadowing techniques at all,

259
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,548
which I certainly
did at her age.

260
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,717
Objectively speaking,
I'd have to give her work

261
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:44,619
a "G," for good.

262
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:45,920
At best.

263
00:09:45,956 --> 00:09:47,555
Are you criticizing
my daughter's art?

264
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,690
And her math skills.

265
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:50,224
I mean, look at
that stick figure,

266
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,126
which I can only
presume is you.

267
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:53,728
It has 14 fingers.

268
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:55,797
And while polydactylism
is a real thing,

269
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:58,232
I hardly think it applies here.

270
00:09:58,268 --> 00:09:59,901
Dr. Wells, you can go,

271
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:03,204
and have Dr. Hodgins swab
the skull for particulates.

272
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,640
Oh, I already did that
before I came in here.

273
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:07,175
But that shouldn't surprise you.

274
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,212
After all,
I am exemplary in all my work.

275
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:19,687
<i>So, listen, about the whole</i>

276
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:21,889
coffee thing this morning,
you know, my apologies.

277
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,358
I-I misunderstood.

278
00:10:23,393 --> 00:10:25,793
The truth is, I'm...
I'm seeing someone.

279
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:28,162
No, I totally get it.
It's fine.

280
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:30,264
So no... no hard feelings?
No.

281
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,100
It's intriguing, but...

282
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:33,868
No, no hard feelings.

283
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:35,069
Wait, what's intriguing?

284
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:37,005
So you said
that you knew the victim,

285
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,106
Frank Kwiatowski?

286
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:39,907
What? Yeah.
No, sort of.

287
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,610
Uh, my-my father used his
services back in the day.

288
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:43,811
Ah, that's right.

289
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,947
Benjamin Aubrey, financier.

290
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:48,216
Arrested for running a
multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme

291
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:51,052
and then running off to Croatia
instead of facing charges.

292
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:52,487
I see you
did your homework.

293
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:54,789
Well, it's just, I like to know
who I'm going out with,

294
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:56,591
or not going out with
as the case may be.

295
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,426
You must have some
profound daddy issues.

296
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:01,529
So why did your father
hire Kwiatowski?

297
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:03,464
You know, honestly, my father
never really talked to me

298
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,932
about his business, okay?

299
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:07,168
He just let me tag
along sometimes.

300
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:08,870
Fascinating.

301
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:10,471
Your daddy issues, I mean.

302
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:13,107
It explains why
you're such a pleaser.

303
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:15,209
Why you say yes to things
that you don't need or want,

304
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:16,210
like coffee.

305
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:17,779
Have you ever seen a therapist?

306
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:20,248
You know, I think I could be
of real help to you.

307
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,119
I'm gonna take that as a no.

308
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:34,996
Look, we deal in delicate
matters, but to be honest,

309
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:37,565
I can't think of anyone who had
the balls to mess with Frank.

310
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,267
He could be intimidating.

311
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:40,835
Did you guys, uh,
remodel recently?

312
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,937
No. Maybe, like,
five years ago. Why?

313
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:44,305
No reason. I just...

314
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,375
I used to come here
a lo... long time ago.

315
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,810
I see you've expanded.

316
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:51,379
A conference room,
second office.

317
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:53,181
Oh, so business is good.

318
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:55,149
Frank was outstanding at his job.
Oh.

319
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:57,318
How was he as a boss?
Good enough.

320
00:11:57,353 --> 00:11:58,486
Well, then I'm curious
why you waited

321
00:11:58,521 --> 00:11:59,854
a week to report
him missing.

322
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,856
Because I was
in Atlanta working.

323
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:03,691
Look, I'm telling you,
if you want them,

324
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:05,359
I've got car rental
and hotel receipts.

325
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:06,795
Not to mention
a dozen eyewitnesses.

326
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,329
Well, speaking
of paperwork,

327
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:10,798
I'm gonna need copies of
all of Frank's case files,

328
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,033
including his computers.

329
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:13,167
Be my guest.

330
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:14,569
Go at it.

331
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:26,581
Okay, come on, Kerry.

332
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:28,983
You and I both know that those
aren't the real files.

333
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:30,418
I don't know
what you're talking about.

334
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:31,619
You know, as a kid,

335
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:34,322
growing up,
I was pretty curious.

336
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:36,324
Tended to snoop
around a lot.

337
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,226
In fact,

338
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:40,194
that's probably
why I became a cop.

339
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,563
Oh, no, I think you became a cop
because your father's

340
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:45,600
a pathological liar and
it made you question everything.

341
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:48,369
Or that's one opinion.

342
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:49,804
Anyway,

343
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,207
as I was saying,
I tended to snoop around a lot,

344
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:56,210
especially when I had
to entertain myself

345
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:59,547
because my father
was too busy for me.

346
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:03,317
That's how I know
that mirror is a two-way.

347
00:13:03,353 --> 00:13:06,787
There's a hidden camera
in that lamp.

348
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:08,789
And...

349
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:11,259
while a lot of these
fixtures have changed--

350
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:14,362
new sink, new faucet--

351
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:18,432
there's still one thing
that hasn't changed.

352
00:13:27,343 --> 00:13:28,609
Where your boss hides

353
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:31,412
all of his most
important files.

354
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:38,270
Hey. I finished my analysis

355
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,175
of the trace
found in the skull wound.

356
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:42,306
I found particulates
of northern white ash.

357
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:44,675
So the blunt force object

358
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,644
that bludgeoned the victim
in the face is made of wood.

359
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,579
Dr. Brennan, I found distinct

360
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:51,782
remodeling on the lateral
surface of the victim's

361
00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:53,250
left proximal tibia.

362
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:54,418
This damage appears

363
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:57,788
to have been inflicted
approximately one year ago.

364
00:13:57,823 --> 00:14:00,257
I'll inform Booth so he can
check hospital records.

365
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:01,692
Hey, by the way,

366
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,061
I looked at the e-mail
of the photo you sent me

367
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:06,296
of your niece's art grade,
but without the original, I...

368
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:07,631
Wh-What are you doing?

369
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,900
Excuse me.
What photo are you referring to?

370
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:11,969
Uh, nothing?

371
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,340
Or maybe not.

372
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,408
It's-it's not a big deal.

373
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:20,410
I mean, Oliver,
he just, he asked me

374
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:22,846
to examine a jpeg of
his niece's report card.

375
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:25,248
Your niece's report card?

376
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:26,249
So Oliver was

377
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:27,918
under suspicion
that the little tyke

378
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:30,921
actually changed
a minus sign into a plus,

379
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:34,124
in order to dupe
her simpleton parents.

380
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,525
I take it

381
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:38,195
that you proved
Dr. Wells'

382
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,297
suspicions to be
misguided at best.

383
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:41,698
Uh, no, actually,

384
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:43,633
it looks like that's
exactly what she did.

385
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:45,202
I mean, it's impossible
to determine

386
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:46,903
without further analysis,

387
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:48,538
but based on the shade
and the thickness

388
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:50,273
of the actual stroke,

389
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:52,943
I mean, I would say that
two different pens were used.

390
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:54,511
Anyway, as you can see,
no big deal.

391
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:57,881
Just doing a little
favor here for a friend.

392
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:03,053
Dr. Brennan,
let me explain.

393
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:04,221
After our last talk,

394
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:05,822
I felt I had been
overly critical,

395
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:08,392
so I came to your office
to apologize,

396
00:15:08,427 --> 00:15:10,494
and that's when I noticed
the inconsistency.

397
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:12,562
Of course, to my credit,
my hunch was correct.

398
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:14,698
My daughter did not cheat.

399
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,400
Well, evidence would
say otherwise.

400
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:18,201
I thought, as
a scientist,

401
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:20,237
you would want
to know the truth.

402
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:29,479
Wow, are you guys finding
as much dirt as I am here?

403
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:32,482
Uh, yeah, great big
heaping mounds of it.

404
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:34,151
I am looking
at a wiretap transcript

405
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:36,286
of a Ukrainian ambassador
who was moonlighting

406
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:38,288
as a... as a arms dealer.
Ooh.

407
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:40,023
That's nothing. I mean,
I've got a lobbyist

408
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:42,692
who paid our victim to blackmail
a prep school headmaster

409
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:44,895
so his doofus son
could get in.

410
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,129
Huh. Uh-oh.

411
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:46,997
You find something?

412
00:15:47,032 --> 00:15:48,865
Yes and no.

413
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:51,068
What do you got?
It's your father's file.

414
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:54,771
I mean, you should be
the one to open it.

415
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:56,139
No.

416
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:58,341
My father has
no relevance to the case.

417
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:00,310
He's been out of the country
for 18 years.

418
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:02,546
It would be unethical
for me to read it.

419
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:04,281
But aren't you
the least bit curious?

420
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:06,216
Not at all.

421
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:07,084
Whoa, wait a second.

422
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:08,718
Hold up, guys.
Look, the lab found

423
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:11,021
evidence that our victim's left
leg was shattered a year ago.

424
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:13,557
Wait, shattered, like a
car accident shattered?

425
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,158
They're saying
it was a blunt force,

426
00:16:15,194 --> 00:16:18,495
so it would be
a bat or a pipe.

427
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,697
Okay, I'm sorry,
but are we just gonna breeze

428
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:22,065
right by your father's file?

429
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:24,034
Is that what we're doing here?
We're working.

430
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,702
Okay, Karen?
Yeah, I know.

431
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:27,504
Just, sitting on a trove
of paternal secrets

432
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,639
while working is-- I'm just
gonna throw it out there--

433
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:32,409
odd, but carry on.

434
00:16:32,444 --> 00:16:33,577
Thank you.

435
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:35,045
So maybe the person
who shattered Frank's leg

436
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,313
came back to finish
the job, right?

437
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:38,415
That doesn't make sense.
Why would the killer

438
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,083
wait a whole year?
Whoa, look at this.

439
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,451
Frank worked for this woman

440
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,587
who was divorcing
a low-life nightclub owner

441
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:44,721
named Jimmy Nasari.

442
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:45,922
Nasari, yeah.

443
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,923
I know this guy.

444
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,425
He's a mid-level
wannabe mobster.

445
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,527
He's been trying to make a
name for himself for years.

446
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:51,828
Right, Jimmy's go-to move

447
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:54,264
was, uh, breaking a man's legs
with his signature bat.

448
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:56,600
That makes sense,
especially as the wood found

449
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:58,401
in the victim's face
was white ash.

450
00:16:58,437 --> 00:17:00,770
Whoa, look
what I found. Okay.

451
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:02,305
Nasari had a payout to his wife.

452
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:06,276
It was court ordered last week
for $12 million.

453
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:08,311
All thanks to the work
of our victim.

454
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:10,515
<i>Wait a second.</i>

455
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:12,015
<i>You're saying that that squint</i>

456
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,617
accused Christine
of cheating? Who?

457
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:15,819
Dr. Wells.
Dr. Wells?

458
00:17:15,854 --> 00:17:17,654
That goofy tall guy
who no one likes?

459
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,758
Dr. Wells had Hodgins examine
a photo of the grade.

460
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:22,993
Hodgins is in on this?

461
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:25,095
Well, he didn't know
what he was testing,

462
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,298
but his analysis
suggests that a minus sign

463
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,300
was changed into a plus.

464
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:33,203
That can't be right.
I mean, Christine wouldn't...

465
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:35,505
What subject was it for?
Art.

466
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,940
Booth,

467
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:39,376
Christine did not forge
a school document

468
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:40,777
for the sake of a grade.

469
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:41,978
Of course she didn't.

470
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:43,713
It's ludicrous.
Absolutely.

471
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:46,183
Our daughter is not
capable of such fraud.

472
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:48,118
Well, she's six years old.
It's impossible.

473
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:49,886
Of course not. Really?

474
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,824
Don't know who you're talking
about. I never met the guy.

475
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,293
All right,
I asked you one question.

476
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:58,328
I already have you on
obstruction of justice.

477
00:17:58,363 --> 00:18:01,231
Look at the picture
again and think.

478
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:02,666
Yeah, all right, fine,
I knew the guy.

479
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:05,268
But I didn't kill him.
What, do I look stupid to you?

480
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:07,537
Your pronounced browridge is
suggestive of Neanderthal man,

481
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:09,172
so yes.

482
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,740
You're kidding me, right?
Get the hell out of here.

483
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:11,841
This is what
I'm not understanding.

484
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:13,009
Help me out here.

485
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:15,078
Why is it that after
you break Frank's legs,

486
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:16,746
he doesn't go to the cops?

487
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:18,114
Perhaps he doesn't press charges
because you threatened

488
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,182
to kill him if he ever talked?

489
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:21,084
Yeah, right.
I wish that's what he did.

490
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,452
I don't understand.

491
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:23,753
Why would you want him
to press charges?

492
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:24,955
Look, Frank Kwiatowski is

493
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,823
no angel, all right?
Instead of shutting the hell up

494
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:28,692
or going to the cops,
you know what he did?

495
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:30,527
He waged an all-out war
against me.

496
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:32,195
Well, what exactly did he do?
What didn't he do?

497
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:33,997
He used his local cop contacts
to shut down

498
00:18:34,032 --> 00:18:35,966
half my clubs
on some zoning violation.

499
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:37,834
And then he goes
to see my mother,

500
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:40,470
who's got Alzheimer's disease,
starts gas-lighting her,

501
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:41,638
telling her things
like I can't afford

502
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:43,139
to keep her in a
nice home anymore.

503
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:45,375
And then my kid
gets expelled from St. Malo's

504
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,577
for having dope on him,
which I know Frank planted.

505
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:49,546
You want me to keep going?

506
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:52,282
So you admit you have
multiple motives to kill.

507
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:55,418
I didn't do it, all right?

508
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:57,721
You were scared of him.

509
00:18:57,756 --> 00:19:00,490
I'm not scared of anyone,
you hear me?

510
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:02,092
All right, look, I need to know
your whereabouts last week.

511
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:05,929
That's easy. I was down at
the shore at one of my hotels.

512
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:09,666
Hey, I found
fresh duck feces

513
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:11,434
on the tread of
the victim's shoe.

514
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,802
I trust

515
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:14,037
you're telling me
this for a reason,

516
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:15,538
other than to make
me say "yuck."

517
00:19:15,574 --> 00:19:17,841
So the feces belonged
to the greater scaup, uh,

518
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:20,043
which is found only in a
few places in the D.C. area.

519
00:19:20,078 --> 00:19:21,645
The first one is
Anacostia Park.

520
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,014
Second one is the
tidal basin, which is

521
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:25,649
near the FDR Memorial.

522
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:29,319
Roaches Run Waterfowl Sanctuary.

523
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:31,154
Which means
the victim was at

524
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:33,056
one of those places at
or near time of death.

525
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:34,591
Good work.

526
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,960
How's my beautiful
and talented wife coming along

527
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:38,328
with the victim's computer?

528
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:39,763
Not great.

529
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:42,065
Frank encrypted his files,
so I'm using

530
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,934
counter-steganography to see
if I can gain access to it.

531
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,002
Let me know when you're done.

532
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:47,904
Yeah.

533
00:19:50,242 --> 00:19:52,409
Uh, Angie.
Yeah?

534
00:19:52,444 --> 00:19:53,977
I have something for you.

535
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:55,145
Oh.

536
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,746
So the bracelet looked

537
00:19:56,782 --> 00:20:00,550
so good on you
that I thought I should

538
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:03,420
get you something
to go along with it.

539
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:06,656
Oh, my God.

540
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:09,225
Wow.

541
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,961
Gosh, that's really
so beautiful,

542
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:13,330
but, um, this is too much.

543
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:14,998
I don't... I don't need
any gifts.

544
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:17,334
No, uh, take it, Angie.

545
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:19,803
I mean, look,
I-I was really terrible to you,

546
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:22,672
and you deserve this,
so go ahead and-and try that on.

547
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,774
It's-it's very sweet,

548
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,710
and, uh, it's
a generous thought,

549
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:27,911
but I don't...
I don't...

550
00:20:27,946 --> 00:20:30,380
Angela, please, just try it on.

551
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:37,620
Okay.

552
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:47,630
Wow.

553
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,567
Yeah, it's-it's awesome.

554
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:53,303
You look amazing.

555
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:54,804
Awesome.

556
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:59,609
So Hotel Victoria
in Atlantic City

557
00:20:59,644 --> 00:21:01,511
just confirmed
Jimmy Nasari's alibi.

558
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:04,080
Don't worry, I think
I found something.

559
00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:05,782
I'm not worried.

560
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:07,751
Well, you're eating
a jelly doughnut

561
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:09,185
in the middle
of the afternoon,

562
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:11,221
and eating is your
coping mechanism, so...

563
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:12,856
Or, yeah, maybe I'm just hungry.

564
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:13,790
Oh, okay.

565
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:15,692
Hey, speaking of
being in denial,

566
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:17,394
I really think you should
read your father's file.

567
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:20,163
Okay, have you read it?

568
00:21:20,198 --> 00:21:21,731
Yes.

569
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,833
Is there anything in it
related to the case?

570
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:26,202
No.

571
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:27,270
Great.

572
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:29,572
Then I'm not reading it.

573
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:32,041
Your discipline is terrifying.

574
00:21:32,077 --> 00:21:33,777
Thank you.
What do you got?

575
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:36,613
Okay, so this is a client
who has an office

576
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:39,082
off of Anacostia Park,
which also happens to be

577
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:42,218
where the greater scaup
duck congregates.

578
00:21:42,254 --> 00:21:43,486
Are you serious?

579
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:44,954
Abraham Froome,
the CEO from,

580
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,856
uh, Froome Tire Centers?

581
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:49,726
Th-This guy's a billionaire
ten times over.

582
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:51,728
Well, it seems like
Froome hired our victim

583
00:21:51,763 --> 00:21:54,864
to retrieve some sort
of blackmail sex tape.

584
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,167
And then the
blackmailer also sent

585
00:21:57,202 --> 00:21:58,568
several still photographs

586
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:00,804
as proof of
what he still possesses.

587
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,805
Oh!

588
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,374
Wow. Oh, man.

589
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:07,043
Super rich really aren't
like the rest of us, are they?

590
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:10,480
Well, it just seems like
Grandpa wanted his nuk-nuk.

591
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,825
So let me get this
straight here, Mr. Froome.

592
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:18,442
You hired Frank because
you were being blackmailed?

593
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:19,375
Yes.

594
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:21,473
Somehow someone made a video

595
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:24,073
while I was staying
at the Hotel Poggio.

596
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,543
The blackmailer sent me
an e-mail demanding

597
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,511
I pay him $2 million.

598
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,547
I asked Frank
to handle it for me.

599
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,748
And then what happened?

600
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,716
Well, at first,
Frank told me not to pay.

601
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,953
He said he would take care
of retrieving the video.

602
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,721
When he came back
several days later,

603
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,658
h-he was badly beaten
about the face.

604
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,926
So you're saying

605
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,061
the blackmailer assaulted him.

606
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:46,796
That's when Frank told me
I should pay,

607
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:49,465
that this blackmailer
was insane,

608
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,234
someone who would
not listen to reason.

609
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,703
Last time I saw Frank
was to give him the money

610
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:55,572
so that we could
pay this guy off.

611
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,574
Wait, so are you telling me

612
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,578
that Frank had $2 million
in cash on him

613
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,246
the day that he died?

614
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,422
Any luck tracking
down an I.P. address

615
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,223
on that e-mail the
blackmailer sent?

616
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,658
No, unfortunately,
it's a dead-end.

617
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,627
He or she used
an overseas proxy,

618
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,696
so there's no way
to trace it.

619
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,998
What about the
still itself?

620
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,367
You just can't get
enough of that, can you?

621
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,768
What can I say?

622
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:26,970
Fetishes are my fetish.

623
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,304
Seriously, though,

624
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,006
I just don't get it.
I know, right?

625
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,008
I mean, if this guy
really wanted to be

626
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,443
in diapers so badly,

627
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,044
he should have just waited
a couple of years.

628
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,648
So, uh, what-what have you got?

629
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,249
Okay, so to be honest,

630
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,820
this is still a work
in progress, but I've applied

631
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,521
an enhanced-resolution
pixel algorithm

632
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,357
to scale up the mirror image
in the background.

633
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,360
Well, the mirror looks like
it's reflecting something.

634
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,796
Yeah, the closet where the
blackmailer took the video from.

635
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,665
Now I'm gonna amp up
the color balance

636
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,267
and brighten
the pixelation.

637
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,902
Now, unfortunately, you still
can't make out the face.

638
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,037
No.

639
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,840
But look at chest level.
It looks like a name tag.

640
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,842
Can you enhance even further?

641
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,577
Uh, no, unfortunately.

642
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,647
But, look, we know the guy's
wearing a green jacket

643
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,482
with a yellow stripe
on its sleeve.

644
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,283
The color scheme
of the Hotel Poggio.

645
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,319
Right, which means
the blackmailer

646
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,554
must be an employee.

647
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,556
<i>Given Mr. Froome's statement</i>

648
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,325
that the last time
he saw the victim,

649
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,926
he was badly beaten
on the face,

650
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,294
I reexamined the
bones for evidence

651
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,363
of a physical
altercation.

652
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,666
You're referring to the victim's
fight with the blackmailer?

653
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,300
Yes. As you can see,

654
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,771
I found bruising to all five
right proximal phalanges.

655
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,141
The placement
of this micro-fracture

656
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,009
on the thumb is strange.

657
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,078
The victim was
an experienced fighter.

658
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,514
Why would he hit
using the top of his fist?

659
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,481
Yes, it's true,

660
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,150
the victim was experienced,

661
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,652
but even the best in their field
can become overconfident

662
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,088
and, quite frankly,
sloppy from time to time.

663
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,824
Dr. Wells, I'm only going
to say this one last time.

664
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:56,659
My daughter did not cheat.

665
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,661
Then there's no reason
not to let Dr. Hodgins

666
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,763
test the ink to
confirm that I'm right.

667
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,465
What about the teeth?

668
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,333
Did I reexamine them?
Yes, of course.

669
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,768
Dental damage
is quite common

670
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,471
in instances of assault.

671
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:12,909
Please note the chip on the
left maxillary first bicuspid.

672
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,211
Suggestive of recent trauma.

673
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:16,512
Also, I see something else.

674
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:17,714
Here on the lingual surfaces

675
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,917
of the central
maxillary incisors,

676
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:24,187
there appears to be
an acid-like discoloration.

677
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,621
Oh.

678
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,756
It's Booth.

679
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,024
H-He's picking me up.

680
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,426
It appears he has a lead
on Abraham Froome's blackmailer.

681
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,161
While you're gone, I'll
have Dr. Hodgins swab

682
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,864
to see if we can discern
what damaged the teeth.

683
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,866
And after
Dr. Hodgins is finished,

684
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:40,436
have him analyze the ink
on my daughter's report card.

685
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,105
An excellent idea.

686
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,107
Perhaps you'd like to place
a little friendly wager

687
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,641
over who is correct.

688
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,344
<i>Bones, you got to be</i>
<i>kidding me, right?</i>

689
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:49,912
You made a bet
with this creep?

690
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,848
Booth, it's not a bet
if you know you're going to win.

691
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,249
Aha, you know,
that's funny,

692
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:55,485
because that's what gambling
addicts say all the time.

693
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,487
Well, if it's any consolation,
it's not a monetary bet.

694
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:00,456
That would be insensitive
and too close to home.

695
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,592
Okay, so what is it, huh?
You're not gonna end up

696
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,727
with a tattoo of this
guy's face or something?

697
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,662
No, of course not,
because I'm going to win.

698
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,064
Okay, you know what?

699
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,232
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

700
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,000
Do me a favor, open up
the file, see what we got.

701
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:13,102
Fine, but I'm going to win.

702
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,705
Okay, Valon Dudeshev.
Yes.

703
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,407
He is a bellhop
at Hotel Poggio.

704
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,376
Right, I called the
manager at the hotel,

705
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:21,811
asked if any
of his employees

706
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,746
showed any signs
of being in a fight.

707
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,548
And Valon showed
such evidence?

708
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,116
No, not exactly.

709
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,051
See, he hasn't come into
work for the past week.

710
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,687
The last time anyone saw
or heard from him

711
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,790
was just before
our victim was killed.

712
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,761
Okay, Valon's
apartment number is 447.

713
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:39,896
Right here.

714
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,464
Okay, I just want you
to stay back.

715
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,965
I don't think
he's gonna come in quietly.

716
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:45,067
Oh, Booth.

717
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,836
I think I hear
someone inside.

718
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,374
FBI.

719
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,608
Okay, stand back.
I think he's coming.

720
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,644
Hello?

721
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:54,877
Valon Dudeshev?

722
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,279
Uh, maybe. Who is it?

723
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,680
It's the FBI.

724
00:26:57,715 --> 00:26:59,649
We need to ask you
some questions.

725
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,517
Okay, ask.
No, open the door,

726
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,485
and we'll ask questions.

727
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,553
No, no, no, no.

728
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,154
I-I answer from here,
like this.

729
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,989
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You're gonna open the door.

730
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,524
If you don't,
I'm gonna break it down.

731
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:13,396
All right, I'm kicking it in,
in three, two, one.

732
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:29,637
I tell you, I did nothing.
I am victim here.

733
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:32,137
Really? You're the
victim? All right.

734
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:33,739
Then do you want to explain
this little, uh,

735
00:27:33,774 --> 00:27:36,675
blackmail video
that you made?

736
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,910
See the stills that
we pulled off it?

737
00:27:38,946 --> 00:27:41,913
So you want to
explain this, huh?

738
00:27:43,484 --> 00:27:44,916
You not understand.

739
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:47,252
This is very bad man.

740
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:48,754
He is very wealthy,
but no tip.

741
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:50,122
This is not reasonable.

742
00:27:50,157 --> 00:27:52,658
You blackmailed him
because he didn't tip you?

743
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:54,760
Blackmail is very harsh.
I only make video

744
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:57,663
and suggest good decision
for family.

745
00:27:57,698 --> 00:27:59,264
I'm sorry,
so what the hell happened?

746
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,433
Frank slipped you the dye
after he handed over the cash?

747
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:05,170
I do not know who this Frank is
you talk about.

748
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:06,271
Frank. This man, Frank.

749
00:28:06,307 --> 00:28:07,773
That's the guy
you beat up.

750
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,107
You told him to
go get the cash,

751
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:11,009
and then you killed him.

752
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:13,979
No, I kill no one!

753
00:28:14,014 --> 00:28:16,481
Last week, I come home,
this man is on couch.

754
00:28:16,517 --> 00:28:17,683
He has gun in hand.

755
00:28:17,718 --> 00:28:20,319
Right, you got into a fight.

756
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:22,654
First, he take video I make,
then he rob me.

757
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,855
Take my cell phone,

758
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:24,856
my-my computer,
everything.

759
00:28:24,892 --> 00:28:25,892
Why?

760
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:27,459
'Cause he crazy.

761
00:28:27,494 --> 00:28:31,563
Then... he tell me to get
in the tub with purple dye.

762
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:33,765
If not, he shoot me.

763
00:28:33,801 --> 00:28:35,000
What about the money?

764
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:36,802
No, no money!

765
00:28:36,837 --> 00:28:38,970
I am victim here.

766
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:40,972
Why else would I look like this?

767
00:28:44,812 --> 00:28:47,612
Dr. Hodgins, do you have
the results from your swab

768
00:28:47,648 --> 00:28:50,349
of the lingual surfaces
of the central incisors?

769
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:51,783
Yes, I do,

770
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:52,984
but I owe you an apology.

771
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,286
I had no idea

772
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:56,154
that that report card
was Christine's.

773
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,157
Does this mean
you have completed

774
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:00,926
your analysis of the ink?

775
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:02,928
What? No.
I-I didn't even start it.

776
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:04,563
I mean, look,
Oliver tried to convince me

777
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:05,831
that you were on board,

778
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:07,199
but do not worry, okay?

779
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:08,834
I know that that was a lie.
It is not.

780
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:10,001
Please, run the test.

781
00:29:10,037 --> 00:29:12,237
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.

782
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:14,339
Yeah, no, I mean,
if that's what you want.

783
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,273
Yes.

784
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:16,742
And...

785
00:29:16,777 --> 00:29:18,744
what about the swab
of the teeth?

786
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:20,812
Right, yeah.
So, uh, what I found was

787
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:22,514
a combination of
hydrochloric acid,

788
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:23,682
potassium chloride

789
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:25,517
and sodium chloride,

790
00:29:25,552 --> 00:29:27,886
or more commonly known
as gastric acid.

791
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:29,955
Meaning the victim regurgitated
around time of death.

792
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,823
Yeah, and since I don't think
this guy was the bulimic type,

793
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:32,858
I had Cam test for poison.

794
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:34,192
And what did she find?

795
00:29:34,228 --> 00:29:35,527
No poison.
Oh.

796
00:29:35,562 --> 00:29:37,129
But she did find
trace amounts of ketamine.

797
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:38,830
Which means that
our killer tried

798
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:40,365
to roofie our P.I.
before giving up

799
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:41,833
and just whacking him
in the face

800
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:42,834
with some blunt force object

801
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,202
made out of wood.

802
00:29:44,238 --> 00:29:47,739
Actually, I'm not so sure
that's what happened.

803
00:29:52,346 --> 00:29:54,346
Okay, let me get
this straight.

804
00:29:54,381 --> 00:29:57,182
Your theory is that the victim
was given the ketamine

805
00:29:57,217 --> 00:29:59,818
in order to disorient him, but
upon feeling the effects...

806
00:29:59,853 --> 00:30:01,787
He ran to the nearest sink

807
00:30:01,822 --> 00:30:03,422
in order to purge the drug
from his system.

808
00:30:03,457 --> 00:30:04,823
Right.

809
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:07,125
Okay, so this is the
rendering of the victim

810
00:30:07,161 --> 00:30:08,226
and the sink
in his office.

811
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:09,394
Which is made
of white ash,

812
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:12,130
same as the particulates

813
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,799
found in the skull fragments.

814
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:16,701
Now all we need to do
is make the avatar throw up

815
00:30:16,737 --> 00:30:20,338
and simulate the head
smashing into the sink.

816
00:30:20,374 --> 00:30:23,975
Uh, sorry, no,
can't do that.

817
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:25,343
Which part?

818
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:27,579
Uh, the smashing of the
skull is no problem,

819
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:28,547
but the vomiting?

820
00:30:28,582 --> 00:30:29,981
No way.
Why not?

821
00:30:30,017 --> 00:30:31,883
Vomiting is disgusting.

822
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,487
Angela, you have created
countless reenactments for me--

823
00:30:35,522 --> 00:30:38,790
stabbings, shootings,
even beheadings.

824
00:30:38,826 --> 00:30:41,660
But now you're saying
no to regurgitation.

825
00:30:41,695 --> 00:30:43,628
Girl's got to have
her standards.

826
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,768
Okay, then the head trauma
alone will have to do.

827
00:30:57,144 --> 00:30:59,845
Oh. Looks like
we have a match.

828
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:06,618
You got anything?
No.

829
00:31:06,653 --> 00:31:08,353
No blood evidence.

830
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:11,356
But based on the scratches
to this wood,

831
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:14,593
I'd say this is
definitely where it happened.

832
00:31:14,628 --> 00:31:17,062
Who had access to this office?
What do you mean?

833
00:31:17,097 --> 00:31:19,030
Well, I mean, you've got a key,
don't you?

834
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:20,298
Yeah, but so what?

835
00:31:20,334 --> 00:31:21,633
I was in Atlanta.

836
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:23,401
Plus, Frank always
kept the door unlocked,

837
00:31:23,437 --> 00:31:25,770
so a friend or client could
come by any time they want.

838
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:31,543
Dr. Brennan, I trust
you put Dr. Hodgins

839
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:34,546
in his place and he's
proceeding with his analysis?

840
00:31:34,581 --> 00:31:36,882
I have, although I am concerned

841
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:39,451
that this wager is
becoming a distraction.

842
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:40,919
Never.

843
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:43,455
In fact, allow me to show
you my latest discovery.

844
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,324
Please note the, oh, so
subtle antemortem damage

845
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,661
adjacent to the left
zygomaticofacial foramen.

846
00:31:49,696 --> 00:31:51,329
Interesting.

847
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:52,964
These micro-fractures
are consistent

848
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,233
with a fist
striking the skull.

849
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:57,903
But the question remains:
who inflicted this damage?

850
00:31:57,938 --> 00:32:00,605
The victim claimed
it was his blackmailer,

851
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:01,940
but that is illogical.

852
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:04,776
Why? Because the blackmailer
was dyed purple?

853
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:06,411
Or perhaps he dyed
himself purple?

854
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:09,781
An action so idiotic,
it was in fact genius.

855
00:32:09,816 --> 00:32:11,016
No, just idiotic.

856
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:13,418
I take it you have a
better explanation?

857
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:17,822
What if the damage to the
victim's first proximal phalanx

858
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:19,758
was self-inflicted?
I don't follow.

859
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:23,328
I'm positing that the victim
caused both injuries to himself.

860
00:32:23,363 --> 00:32:25,363
And you thought my
scenario was idiotic.

861
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:27,866
Why would someone punch
himself in the face?

862
00:32:27,901 --> 00:32:30,902
Oh, uh, actually,
I might have an answer for that.

863
00:32:30,938 --> 00:32:33,471
So we know the
bellhop claimed

864
00:32:33,507 --> 00:32:36,007
the victim stole his
cell phone, his computer,

865
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:37,609
basically anything
that connected him

866
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:39,010
with the outside world.

867
00:32:39,046 --> 00:32:40,145
Yes, by his account,

868
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,180
he was dyed purple
and then robbed.

869
00:32:42,215 --> 00:32:43,882
Right.

870
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:47,385
And since I don't have any
of his electronics to analyze,

871
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:49,888
I thought that I could at least
confirm the date and time

872
00:32:49,923 --> 00:32:51,656
that his online presence
went dark.

873
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:53,258
If they all happened
simultaneously...

874
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:54,593
It would confirm

875
00:32:54,628 --> 00:32:55,627
his account of the events.

876
00:32:55,662 --> 00:32:56,795
Yeah.

877
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,663
Okay, so the bellhop's

878
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:00,432
cell phone,
Twitter account,

879
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:01,900
tablets, I.P. addresses

880
00:33:01,935 --> 00:33:03,969
all went dark around
6:43 p.m. on Friday.

881
00:33:04,004 --> 00:33:06,404
So the bellhop
was telling the truth.

882
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,106
And that's not even
the best part.

883
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:12,243
Abraham Froome's bank accounts
show that he withdrew $2 million

884
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,346
the day after Valon
went off the grid.

885
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:15,747
So the victim lied.

886
00:33:15,782 --> 00:33:17,015
He secured the video,

887
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,650
but he kept
the money for himself.

888
00:33:18,685 --> 00:33:21,987
And he bruised
and bloodied his own face

889
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:24,222
in order to sell his story.

890
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,604
Hey.

891
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:32,572
Did some digging around for
Froome's missing two million,

892
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:34,741
I found something I think
you're gonna want to see.

893
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:36,676
Kerry Napoli's
bank statement.

894
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:38,044
Well, where's
two million?

895
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,679
All I see is a
thousand dollars here.

896
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:42,415
You got to go to the second
page, okay, third line down.

897
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,817
Look at the bank fee
for $62.58.

898
00:33:44,853 --> 00:33:47,286
Safety deposit box.

899
00:33:47,322 --> 00:33:49,422
Ten by ten inches.
She just got it a week ago.

900
00:33:49,457 --> 00:33:51,524
Big enough to hold
two million.

901
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:53,660
Bring her in, will you?

902
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:57,497
What the hell?

903
00:33:57,532 --> 00:34:00,233
You had no right to get into
my safety deposit box.

904
00:34:00,268 --> 00:34:02,468
There was no probable cause.

905
00:34:02,504 --> 00:34:04,504
One of your cases,
a-a few years back,

906
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:07,106
you and Frank helped
an Omani prince

907
00:34:07,142 --> 00:34:10,143
beat a drunk driving
manslaughter charge in Jersey.

908
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:11,178
You're kidding, right?

909
00:34:11,212 --> 00:34:12,645
The Patriot Act?
That's how you got a warrant?

910
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:14,247
See it turns out,
our friends

911
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:16,282
at Homeland Security were
curious about what was inside.

912
00:34:16,317 --> 00:34:18,084
They wanted to make
sure you weren't

913
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,485
aiding and abetting
a known terrorist.

914
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:20,853
Yeah.

915
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:25,925
Look, I opened
that safety deposit box

916
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,927
because that's what
Frank wanted.

917
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:30,463
He had me put
the money in there.

918
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:33,166
Because you were
having an affair.

919
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:36,836
Frank's plan was for us
to leave the business

920
00:34:36,871 --> 00:34:38,638
and move to Amsterdam.

921
00:34:38,673 --> 00:34:40,273
Maybe South America.

922
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:42,308
Why didn't you tell us
about this sooner?

923
00:34:42,343 --> 00:34:43,643
Why do you think?

924
00:34:43,678 --> 00:34:45,578
Look, I know this looks bad,
but I swear,

925
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:47,714
I was just doing
what Frank told me to do.

926
00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:49,348
And what about Frank's wife?

927
00:34:49,384 --> 00:34:50,950
Was she aware of the affair?

928
00:34:50,985 --> 00:34:53,119
Honestly, I don't know.

929
00:34:53,154 --> 00:34:54,787
Kerry, we're gonna need

930
00:34:54,823 --> 00:34:57,056
to hold you here
until further notice.

931
00:34:57,092 --> 00:34:58,458
Fine.

932
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:00,927
But I would like to speak
to an attorney.

933
00:35:03,865 --> 00:35:06,933
Hey, Dr. B, I got results for
both of the tests you ordered.

934
00:35:06,968 --> 00:35:08,234
What do you mean, both?

935
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:09,736
I thought we were just
waiting on the ink.

936
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:12,371
We were, but then I found
something probative

937
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:14,140
that you missed.
That's impossible.

938
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:15,608
I haven't missed anything.

939
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:17,443
Look here.

940
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:21,180
We know the victim's head
was driven into his own sink.

941
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,517
However, what you failed
to do was closely examine

942
00:35:24,552 --> 00:35:27,019
the posterior surface of
the skull for any damage

943
00:35:27,055 --> 00:35:31,457
due to a forward
thrusting blow.

944
00:35:31,493 --> 00:35:33,593
And as you can see,

945
00:35:33,628 --> 00:35:36,496
there is
a faint scratch adjacent

946
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:39,565
to the nuchal crest
of the occipital bone.

947
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:42,902
I see. And this scratch was
likely caused by the killer?

948
00:35:42,937 --> 00:35:44,137
Which results
would you like first?

949
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:45,772
The swab or the ink analysis?

950
00:35:45,807 --> 00:35:48,975
I'll let Dr. Wells decide.

951
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,610
The ink analysis.

952
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:53,079
Okay, so I ran
a thin layer chromatography

953
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:55,948
on the actual plus sign.

954
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,083
And then,
to confirm the results,

955
00:35:57,118 --> 00:35:58,651
I actually processed it through

956
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:02,588
imaging electro-spray
ionization, as you can see.

957
00:36:02,624 --> 00:36:04,924
The results
were definitive.

958
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:08,828
The plus sign was made up
of two different inks.

959
00:36:08,863 --> 00:36:11,130
As a gentleman,
I will do you the courtesy

960
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,499
of not saying "I told you so."

961
00:36:13,535 --> 00:36:15,902
Even though you just did.

962
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:18,004
Dr. Hodgins,
what of the test

963
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,539
that actually matters,

964
00:36:19,574 --> 00:36:21,707
the swab results
from the occipital?

965
00:36:21,743 --> 00:36:24,443
So, the mass-spec
found evidence

966
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,913
of zirconium dioxide
and nine karat gold.

967
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:28,548
So the victim was
likely scratched

968
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:31,450
by some cheap,
gaudy jewelry made of

969
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:34,187
low-grade gold
and cubic zirconia.

970
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:36,289
I'll let Booth know right away.

971
00:36:39,394 --> 00:36:40,593
All right, just listen to me,
all right?

972
00:36:40,628 --> 00:36:41,594
Hold on for a second, okay?

973
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:43,262
If you play ball with me,

974
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:45,298
none of this is gonna make it
to the papers, all right?

975
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,666
Great.

976
00:36:46,701 --> 00:36:49,235
Okay, you'll be hearing
from me soon. Thanks.

977
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,970
Booth, what is going on?
I just looked in interrogation.

978
00:36:51,005 --> 00:36:52,738
I thought you were bringing
in the wife, Lissa Bowman.

979
00:36:52,774 --> 00:36:54,473
Oh, yeah, I was,
until I took a look

980
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:56,008
at her monthly
credit card statement.

981
00:36:56,044 --> 00:36:57,944
Take a look at that, huh?

982
00:36:57,979 --> 00:37:00,112
Ten times more than my mortgage.
Okay, she's rich.

983
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:02,014
So what?
Exactly, she's rich.

984
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,482
Okay, rich people
don't go around

985
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:05,585
wearing nine karat gold
or cubic zirconia.

986
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,320
Only young women
wear that.

987
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:08,621
Yeah, but she's
got a motive.

988
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:09,989
Her husband was
having an affair.

989
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:11,424
Kerry Napoli's got an alibi.

990
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:13,459
Does she?
I don't think so.

991
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:20,166
Kerry, I'm Agent Booth.

992
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:21,601
I have some questions for you.

993
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:23,502
Agent Booth, before
you say another word,

994
00:37:23,538 --> 00:37:25,471
I'll have you know
my client is willing

995
00:37:25,506 --> 00:37:26,739
to confess to her part

996
00:37:26,774 --> 00:37:28,674
in robbing Mr. Froome.

997
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,042
And what about
murdering your boss?

998
00:37:30,078 --> 00:37:31,677
I loved Frank;
we were going to spend

999
00:37:31,713 --> 00:37:32,845
the rest of our lives together.

1000
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:34,513
I don't buy it.
You're a P.I.

1001
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:35,982
You're not some
naive little girl

1002
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:38,017
who believes in
happily ever after.

1003
00:37:38,052 --> 00:37:41,254
You killed him and you took the
money when you had the chance.

1004
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:43,289
Really? That's your theory?

1005
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:45,324
Well, there's just
one little problem.

1006
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,027
I've got a dozen witnesses
that saw me in Atlanta that day.

1007
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:49,495
Right, your alibi,
but you see,

1008
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,463
here's the thing.

1009
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:52,265
See, your witnesses
are your clients.

1010
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,967
So what?
So...

1011
00:37:55,003 --> 00:37:58,037
I know you have dirt on every
single one of your clients.

1012
00:37:58,072 --> 00:38:00,206
You blackmailed them
for an alibi.

1013
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:02,408
He's lying.

1014
00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:04,377
There's no way
you can prove that.

1015
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:06,178
I just talked
to one of your clients,

1016
00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:08,881
and when I told him that
you couldn't extort him anymore,

1017
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:11,784
let's just say he was
singing a different tune.

1018
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:15,087
You're bluffing; you're just
trying to get me to confess.

1019
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:16,255
Bluffing?

1020
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:19,058
No, I'm not bluffing.

1021
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:21,060
I don't need a confession.

1022
00:38:21,095 --> 00:38:23,462
See, I have evidence,
means and motive.

1023
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:26,299
Which means you're under arrest.

1024
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:38,144
This is nice,

1025
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:40,079
and a long time coming.

1026
00:38:40,114 --> 00:38:43,683
In fact, I would like to
propose a toast to Hodgins.

1027
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:45,618
It's great to see you
out and about again.

1028
00:38:45,653 --> 00:38:46,886
Here, here.

1029
00:38:46,921 --> 00:38:47,921
Cheers.

1030
00:38:47,956 --> 00:38:49,722
Good to have
you back, old man.

1031
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:52,725
And to Angela, for forcing
Hodgins to get out and about.

1032
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,394
Thank you. It was not easy.

1033
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,563
Yeah, how exactly
did you do that?

1034
00:38:57,598 --> 00:39:01,367
Oh, by giving away the jewelry
that, uh, I gave her.

1035
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:02,702
Yep.

1036
00:39:02,737 --> 00:39:04,804
I have to say, I think
these look pretty fab on me.

1037
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:07,740
And the only way that
Hodgins can get them back

1038
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:10,409
to return them is
by going out with me tonight

1039
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:13,512
and three more times
this month.

1040
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:14,780
Drives a hard bargain, huh?

1041
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:15,816
Well, until then,

1042
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,950
these babies are mine.

1043
00:39:24,258 --> 00:39:26,692
Hi, there.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1044
00:39:26,728 --> 00:39:28,127
I'm Camille Saroyan.

1045
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:29,528
I don't think
we've officially met.

1046
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:30,696
You must be Karen Delfs.

1047
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:32,131
Yes, nice to meet you.

1048
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,967
And so weird,
because I feel like I know you,

1049
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:37,003
since I've read
your psychological profile.

1050
00:39:38,072 --> 00:39:39,672
Can I speak to you for a second?

1051
00:39:39,707 --> 00:39:41,774
Absolutely.
Be right back.

1052
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:43,309
Bye.

1053
00:39:44,345 --> 00:39:46,245
Okay, what is going on?

1054
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,681
You're not gonna ask me
to coffee again, are you?

1055
00:39:48,716 --> 00:39:49,682
No.

1056
00:39:49,717 --> 00:39:50,883
Get over yourself.

1057
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:53,019
I actually found a date for
tonight, thank you very much.

1058
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:54,653
He's right over there.

1059
00:39:54,689 --> 00:39:56,288
Really? Wow.

1060
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:58,257
Yeah. To be honest
with you, he's...

1061
00:39:58,292 --> 00:39:59,992
he's dumb as a box of hair,

1062
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:01,660
but, you know,
beggars can't be choosers.

1063
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:03,396
Besides, not like
I want something long-term.

1064
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:06,465
I'm just sort of looking for one
last fling before I leave town.

1065
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:08,367
I'm sorry, you
going somewhere?

1066
00:40:08,403 --> 00:40:11,704
Oh, I'm being transferred
to Kansas City on Monday.

1067
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:12,805
Really?
Yeah.

1068
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,774
I had no idea.
Well.

1069
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,709
Listen, why don't you let me,
uh, buy you a drink

1070
00:40:16,744 --> 00:40:18,044
before you hit the road.

1071
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,746
No, no, no. I really,
um, I have to get going,

1072
00:40:20,782 --> 00:40:24,383
but I think you need
to take a look at this first.

1073
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:26,285
Karen, I already
told you, look,

1074
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,853
I'm not reading
this file, okay?

1075
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:29,855
What happened with my
father, it's in the past.

1076
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:31,023
I'm-I'm over it.

1077
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:32,658
No, see,
it's not in the past.

1078
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:34,660
This file was started
six months ago.

1079
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:35,861
Your dad isn't
abroad anymore.

1080
00:40:35,897 --> 00:40:36,962
He's here.

1081
00:40:36,998 --> 00:40:38,230
He's in D.C.

1082
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:41,734
And the person
that he's investigating...

1083
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:44,003
it's you.

1084
00:41:01,656 --> 00:41:03,856
What's going on?
Are you okay?

1085
00:41:03,891 --> 00:41:05,024
No, I'm not.

1086
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:06,659
I lost my bet
with Dr. Wells,

1087
00:41:06,694 --> 00:41:08,894
and as a result,
I have to pay up.

1088
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,330
Great. What is it?
What do you have to do?

1089
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:12,531
It's not funny.

1090
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:15,167
I'm now the voice
mail on his phone.

1091
00:41:15,203 --> 00:41:17,937
This is what he
had me record.

1092
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:19,672
Hmm.

1093
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:21,407
Okay. "Hello.

1094
00:41:21,442 --> 00:41:24,477
"You've reached the voice mail
for Dr. Oliver Wells,

1095
00:41:24,512 --> 00:41:26,278
"the most brilliant

1096
00:41:26,314 --> 00:41:28,914
"forensic anthropologist
in the history

1097
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,882
of the Jeffersonian."

1098
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:31,357
Bones, this is, like,
two pages long.

1099
00:41:31,385 --> 00:41:33,052
How can you do that?
It's humiliating.

1100
00:41:33,087 --> 00:41:35,454
And what's worse
is that tomorrow

1101
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,490
you and I will have
to have a conversation

1102
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:39,291
with Christine
about cheating.

1103
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:40,693
No, we don't.

1104
00:41:40,728 --> 00:41:41,760
Yes, we do.

1105
00:41:41,796 --> 00:41:42,995
The grade was altered, Booth.

1106
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,264
It was scientifically proven.

1107
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:46,599
Uh-uh, you're looking
at it all wrong.

1108
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:49,268
Turn the report card over.
Look at the teacher's signature.

1109
00:41:50,471 --> 00:41:52,771
Ink. Ink, ink, color, color.
Okay. What?

1110
00:41:54,008 --> 00:41:55,708
Oh, wait.

1111
00:41:55,743 --> 00:41:58,978
It appears the signature
is made up of the same ink

1112
00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:01,647
that was used to
complete the plus sign.

1113
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:03,282
Exactly.
And you really think

1114
00:42:03,317 --> 00:42:06,018
that our little girl
would be able to, what,

1115
00:42:06,053 --> 00:42:07,253
forge an adult's signature?

1116
00:42:07,288 --> 00:42:08,687
Of course not.

1117
00:42:08,723 --> 00:42:10,956
I talked to the teacher today,
Mrs. Gallagher,

1118
00:42:10,992 --> 00:42:12,758
and she told me
that she ran out of ink

1119
00:42:12,793 --> 00:42:14,760
halfway through
the report card.

1120
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:15,961
So she picked up another pen.

1121
00:42:15,997 --> 00:42:17,437
And finished
what she intended to do,

1122
00:42:17,465 --> 00:42:21,133
and that was give our brilliant
little kid an E-plus in Art.

1123
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:22,535
I knew it!

1124
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,802
What? What?
What? What?

1125
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:25,104
I knew it. I knew it!

1126
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:26,438
Yeah!
See, you should admit it.

1127
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:28,674
Admit it
that your science is bunk.

1128
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:30,576
Booth, no, technically,
the science was not,

1129
00:42:30,611 --> 00:42:34,480
but I will concede I did not
see the complete picture.

1130
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:36,615
What are you doing?
I'm calling Dr. Wells.

1131
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:40,186
Uh, he needs to change his
voice mail immediately.

1132
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:42,154
Hello. You
have reached the voice mail...

1133
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,155
Okay, Bones, you can
fast-forward that

1134
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:44,356
by just pressing the pound...
No, hold on.

1135
00:42:44,392 --> 00:42:45,724
I want to hear it. I...
You have to admit,

1136
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,725
I have an excellent voice.

1137
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:47,893
What?
Are you kidding me?

1138
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:49,261
Yes, it's quite sonorous.

1139
00:42:49,297 --> 00:42:50,462
Sonorous? What is that?

1140
00:42:50,498 --> 00:42:52,231
Sonorous.
What do you mean?

1141
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:53,332
Bypass it.
Press pound once.

1142
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:54,300
No, Booth, shh.

1143
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,202
If you keep talking...

1144
00:42:58,694 --> 00:43:05,194
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==
<font color="#00FFFF">@elder_man</font>

1145
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:31,846
What's that mean?
