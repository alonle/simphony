were never pressed.

00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,574
For a six-pack of beer, so...

354
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,476
Cleaning up the streets
<i>and</i> fiscally responsible.

355
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,794
You ought to run for office.

356
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,012
Look out,
Mayor Goodman.

357
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,748
Hey, I gave you his
wallet and his...

358
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,917
phone...thing.
What are the odds

359
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,969
you'll just cut
me loose, huh?

360
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,454
This is a phone?

361
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,589
Didn't look like any phone
I'd seen, either.

362
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,925
But I'm a couple
iPhones behind.

363
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,093
Yeah, I'll bet you are.

364
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,311
<i>It's not a phone.</i>

365
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,263
It's a wearable camcorder.

366
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,599
Wireless video camera
and receiver.

367
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,284
Our morgue zombie
was using it.

368
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,538
Well, grab some popcorn.

369
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,875
Tonight, we take
the ultimate step.

370
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,778
Beyond our past journeys
of the mind.

371
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,446
Tonight, we free ourselves

372
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,715
from the physical plane.

373
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,417
Unspooling the mortal coil,

374
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:07,786
we seek the mystery
that lies beyond...

375
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,388
Hey, Discovery Channel,

376
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,523
kill the speech and let's
kill some brain cells.

377
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,159
This guy on the left-- his
clothing matches the description

378
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,327
of our alley zombie.

379
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,462
It's a dead man's party.

380
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,298
Except the third person
looks like a woman.

381
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,732
DR. ADEN:
<i>How could they do this?</i>

382
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,100
What have
they done?

383
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,403
If they've given it to
some health club...

384
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,505
Dr. Aden, slow down.

385
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,874
Dude. You going to tell us
what we're taking?

386
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,360
No need to add baggage to your trip.

387
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,861
Trust me, Kurt.

388
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,213
It's going to be an adventure.

389
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,482
It's time
to put your cameras on.

390
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,551
See you on re-entry.

391
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,423
Godspeed, Alice.

392
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:50,229
Max's friends Kurt and Alice.

393
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,764
Maybe we can get access to Max's
university email account;

394
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:53,765
check his contacts.

395
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,000
See who his co-pilots were.

396
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,551
Yeah.

397
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,881
Angelfish. Triggerfish.

398
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,718
Blue-ringed octopus.

399
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,703
All poisonous.

400
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,355
All alive.

401
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,758
Someone has been in here
on a regular basis.

402
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,860
20 minutes after ingestion.

403
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,863
Effects are manifesting.

404
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,401
So Max has made his way

405
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:33,438
to the Strip. He's at the plaza
by the Tangiers.

406
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,591
Increasing numbness
of the mouth.

407
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,545
S... Speech is becoming
difficult.

408
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:44,950
Numbness spreading.

409
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:49,321
That hum.

410
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,907
The fish tank filter.

411
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,992
No, no, it's another harmonic.

412
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,842
She's here!

413
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,110
Oh, my...

414
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,479
<i>Santa Maria,</i> my <i>Nautilus!</i>

415
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,684
The vessel of all my dreams.

416
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,951
Dr. Aden!

417
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,587
Oh.

418
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,523
That's not Max Ferris.

419
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,091
That's our alley zombie.

420
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,060
De-animated.

421
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,303
The good doctor is content

422
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,938
to wait in the hall.
He hasn't had

423
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,206
this much excitement
since Altamont.

424
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,540
Or so he says.

425
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:45,109
Police and coroners
are on their way.

426
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:47,578
Pulled the victim's wallet.
Kurt Dawson.

427
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,597
Lived near campus,

428
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,749
but his student ID expired
about a year ago.

429
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:53,100
Dropped out of school.

430
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,019
Or dropped out
of reality.

431
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,587
A sensory deprivation tank.

432
00:20:57,939 --> 00:21:00,741
Did you ever see that movie
<i>Altered States?</i>

433
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:02,276
Oh. Yeah.
My mom took me.

434
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,929
She found it
therapeutic, calming.

435
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:06,530
Says it all.

436
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,466
- I saw it with some really good buds.
- Go, Dr. Ray.

437
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,285
I know. I only talk
like a square.

438
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,872
Tank water's highly salinated;
kept at body temp

439
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,241
so the user floats

440
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,510
in complete silence
and darkness.

441
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:21,679
Blocking out all
earthly stimuli.

442
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,799
You know, in the movie
<i>Altered States,</i>

443
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,751
William Hurt went
into the tank naked.

444
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:30,120
To strip the self down
to one's primitive,

445
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,655
disembodied being

446
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,457
is how you free the
mind, allowing it

447
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,892
to venture
into other realms.

448
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,293
You wouldn't want
to go venturing

449
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,995
in ten pounds of
wet clothes and sneakers.

450
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,899
Maybe the tank
wasn't his idea.

451
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,768
I noticed some faint bruising
that started to develop

452
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,203
on Kurt's back and shoulder.

453
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,106
So, I snapped
some infrared photos.

454
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,774
Hand marks.
He was held down.

455
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,627
That's one way to drown in
just ten inches of water.

456
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,479
So drowning is COD?

457
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,997
Heavy, edematous lungs,

458
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,351
and fluid in his sphenoid sinus
make it pretty clear.

459
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,486
I thought maybe you'd
start chaining them down.

460
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,254
Although yanking out
vital organs is

461
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,889
a good way to
keep the clients.

462
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:07,758
Henry.

463
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,095
Right. Um, found
trace of Tetrodotoxin--

464
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:12,496
TTX-- in his system.

465
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,264
It's a naturally
occurring poison,

466
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,534
1,200 times more
toxic than cyanide.

467
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,504
It's present in a variety
of sea creatures.

468
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,606
<i>The toxin blocks</i>
<i>sodium channels,</i>

469
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:24,742
<i>blacking out the body's</i>
<i>nervous system.</i>

470
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:26,694
<i>A dose the size</i>
<i>of a pinhead can kill,</i>

471
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,346
<i>and short of killing, it can</i>
<i>completely paralyze a person</i>

472
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,515
<i>for hours.</i>

473
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,551
Considering his condition
in that alley, I checked out

474
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,388
the half-life table for TTX,
and the current level of toxin

475
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:39,356
in him would be consistent
with a dose

476
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,325
of two milligrams
16 hours ago.

477
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,194
Enough to paralyze, suppress
heartbeat and breathing,

478
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,663
and get him mistaken for dead.

479
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:49,466
There was a fish tank with
some poisonous specimens

480
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,801
in the same room
we found him in.

481
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,776
Could the toxins have been
extracted from them?

482
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,539
Sure. With some sophisticated
biochem resources.

483
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,508
Although there were two
other substances present

484
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:01,645
in his system--
LSD and cannabis.

485
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,349
Body was frozen,
mind was ablaze.

486
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,034
I've been there.

487
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:08,902
<i>This one's actually dead.</i>

488
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,188
Congratulations.
You're batting .500.

489
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:14,041
Yeah, great for a hitter,
bad for pronouncing death.

490
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:17,428
Let me see your EKG.

491
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,965
What are you looking for, Doc?

492
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,235
Your zombie from the Strip
was under the influence

493
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,870
of a paralytic,

494
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,073
which we would have known if
you'd had the gain on this unit

495
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,174
correctly calibrated,

496
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:31,809
which it's not.

497
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:34,344
The way you've got it set, it
wouldn't pick up my heartbeat.

498
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,080
I'd be a flat-liner.

499
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,015
You're lucky
you're not benched.

500
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,117
Misdiagnose the undead again,

501
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,052
put my assistant
in harm's way,

502
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,655
and you'll find yourself
unemployed.

503
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:56,567
Footprints in salt water
leading towards the door.

504
00:23:56,634 --> 00:24:00,070
The vic was wearing sneakers,
size eights.

505
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,674
Yeah, well, these feet
are at least size 11 or 12.

506
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:06,009
Maybe his pal Max
came back here first.

507
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,319
I've got some
light blue fibers here.

508
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:18,889
Same as the T-shirt Max Ferris
was wearing in the morgue.

509
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,324
So...

510
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:22,976
<i>Max makes a break</i>
<i>from the coroner's office,</i>

511
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:27,798
<i>comes here, dumps his clothes,</i>
<i>gets in the tank to decompress.</i>

512
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,266
<i>And Kurt Dawson shows up.</i>

513
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,469
<i>They get into some sort</i>
<i>of drug-induced fight.</i>

514
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:41,645
<i>Max wins and walks out of here.</i>

515
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,190
Hey, Sara.

516
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,341
Hmm?

517
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:57,627
Looks like Kurt lost his camera
in the fight.

518
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,232
LSD and Tetrodotoxin--
"voodoo powder"--

519
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,001
curious combination.

520
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:06,436
To paralyze yourself

521
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,938
in order to free yourself...

522
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,773
Well, what kind
of state of mind

523
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,676
would that produce in an
individual-- this cocktail?

524
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,646
There's an entire spectrum
of possibilities.

525
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:17,147
Blazing,

526
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,117
manic lucidity,
to oppressive darkness.

527
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,818
Designer drugs--

528
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:25,155
one size does not fit all.

529
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:27,958
Could this cocktail produce,
in certain individuals,

530
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,860
uncontrollable rage, say?

531
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,296
Why do you ask?

532
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,631
Well, one of our young
explorers killed the other.

533
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:38,835
Well, I would have to know
more about the particulars

534
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:40,470
of the situation.

535
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:44,007
There's no fighting in
the war room, Dr. Strangelove.

536
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:47,411
I want you to
look at something.

537
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:49,046
...beyond our past
journeys of the mind.

538
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:52,349
Tonight, we free ourselves
from the physical plane.

539
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,352
Unspooling the mortal coil,

540
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,287
we seek the mystery
that lies beyond.

541
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,856
Hey, Discovery Channel,
kill the speech

542
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:01,658
and let's kill some brain cells.

543
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,077
Dude, are you going to tell us
what we're taking?

544
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,696
No need to add baggage
to your trip.

545
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:08,432
Flag on the play.

546
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:11,301
This young Columbus
didn't prepare his crew.

547
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,937
He knew what the toxins
would induce.

548
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,757
There's a vast difference
between leading others

549
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:21,011
into the beyond, and throwing
them into it unwittingly.

550
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:22,262
To some,

551
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,248
that's sinister science,

552
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:26,583
and could inspire
rage and fury.

553
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,019
So, Kurt, not knowing
what he was taking,

554
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,289
survives the
paralyzing nightmare.

555
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,058
Comes back to confront Max.

556
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:38,578
They fight.
Max kills Kurt.

557
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:44,101
Yes. The reckless master
kills the wronged squire.

558
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:46,503
Sounds like a role you're
not unfamiliar with.

559
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,940
Max was modeling himself
after you, Dr. Aden.

560
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,341
You and your work.

561
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,177
And here, you see,
he sent his friends

562
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:57,514
Alice and Kurt, unwittingly
as you said, into the fire.

563
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:02,886
Probably felt like it was
a... a worthy sacrifice.

564
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,423
Knowledge demands its payment.

565
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,025
It's always nice when somebody

566
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:09,993
picks up the bill
for you, though.

567
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,949
Went through Kurt Dawson's
e-mail accounts.

568
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,035
Found a number of messages
exchanged between him,

569
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:22,122
Max Ferris and another WLVU
student, Alice Katsu.

570
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:23,407
Alice from the video.

571
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:25,042
Yeah. Biochem major.

572
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:27,978
And like Kurt, she seemed
to be under Max's spell.

573
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,630
Agreeing to his every
experimental whim,

574
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,749
late night meetings
in the abandoned lab,

575
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,152
rambling discussions
on the afterlife.

576
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:36,753
Well, we know what happened
to Max's other friend.

577
00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:37,954
We need to find Alice.

578
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:40,123
Do you have any earthly
contact info on her?

579
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:43,894
So, Mr. Katsu, when was the last
time you saw your sister?

580
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:45,095
Three days ago.

581
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:46,430
It's just Alice
and me here.

582
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:48,181
When she's at school
and I'm at work

583
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,733
sometimes we go
a couple of days

584
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,967
without even bumping
into each other.

585
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:53,470
Even when she's
here, she's quiet.

586
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,805
Sometimes, it feels like having
a ghost in the house.

587
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,616
Mom liked jelly beans.

588
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:09,252
It's a Shinto shrine--
offering for the dead.

589
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,955
Alice even plucked
out the black ones.

590
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,097
She's got some

591
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:21,665
academic honors awards

592
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,668
from the past few semesters,

593
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,104
but an academic probation letter
from just a month ago.

594
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:30,006
A card from her mom's funeral

595
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,174
five months ago.

596
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:32,509
Doesn't take a detective.

597
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,578
Mom's death took a toll.

598
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:38,899
Ooh, another one of Dr. Aden's
notebooks.

599
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:50,694
"Question of crossing over
physically versus mentally.

600
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,696
Are they inextricably linked?"

601
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:59,035
She took a picture
of Mom's grave every day.

602
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:01,571
Capturing the change in light
and seasons.

603
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,840
Trying to shape something
living out of the dead.

604
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:08,278
I think, while Max Ferris
dosed himself

605
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,447
to explore the mysteries
of the afterlife,

606
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,749
and Kurt was out
for a good time, Alice...

607
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,385
Was traveling in search
of someone.

608
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,853
Maybe we'll find Alice

609
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,072
if we look in the same direction
she was looking.

610
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,566
Groundskeeper said it was
right around here somewhere.

611
00:29:32,736 --> 00:29:35,338
I don't think they're
going anywhere, Mitch.

612
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,240
Yeah, right.

613
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,679
Hey.

614
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,967
Alice?

615
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:55,592
Max?

616
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,630
Max.

617
00:30:03,784 --> 00:30:06,069
Whoa!

618
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,821
Down. On your knees.

619
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,276
I thought she'd be here.

620
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,611
Max, you're crashing
from a bad trip.

621
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,163
We need to get you
to a hospital.

622
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:18,715
Stop, Max!

623
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:20,083
Stop!

624
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:28,225
Stop! Max!

625
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,150
Oh, my God!

626
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:43,657
No pulse.

627
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,326
I'm cuffing him anyway.
Stand back, sir.

628
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,145
Dr. Aden said this was going
to end badly.

629
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:50,780
We have two dead.

630
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:53,450
Let's hope there's still
time for Alice.

631
00:31:31,065 --> 00:31:33,783
♪ ♪

632
00:31:56,323 --> 00:31:58,124
♪ ♪

633
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:12,379
The notebook I found
in Alice Katsu's room

634
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,475
is a match to Dr. Aden's
handwriting,

635
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:17,544
but the ink looked fresh,
so I tested it.

636
00:32:17,745 --> 00:32:22,182
It is a date-tag match to a formula
that's only been around a couple of years.

637
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,618
Which means Dr. Aden wrote
those notes recently.

638
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:28,018
Right. The notebook was not
among his archived papers.

639
00:32:28,086 --> 00:32:29,653
So how did Alice get it?

640
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:31,522
From the doctor himself.

641
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,891
He and Alice
were e-mail buddies.

642
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,526
She initiated contact
five months ago.

643
00:32:35,594 --> 00:32:37,928
- When her mother died.
- Hmm.

644
00:32:37,996 --> 00:32:40,331
But Aden is not exactly
advertising on bus benches.

645
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:43,367
Alice saw an anonymous commenter on a
Web site about the doctor's past work.

646
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:45,169
She kind of felt like

647
00:32:45,237 --> 00:32:47,054
Mr. Anonymous knew
a little bit too much.

648
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:49,640
So she e-mails, "Dear sir,

649
00:32:49,691 --> 00:32:52,059
"I'm convinced by your
brilliant insights

650
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:53,544
"that you are
Dr. Aden himself.

651
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:56,347
"I'm a great admirer of your
courageous research

652
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:57,982
"into the afterlife.

653
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:00,150
I want to follow
in your footsteps."

654
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:01,919
He was quick to respond,

655
00:33:01,987 --> 00:33:03,420
"Glad to have an acolyte,"

656
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,322
and encouraged her
to find more of them.

657
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,825
Max and Kurt.

658
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:09,493
And we thought Max

659
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:11,161
was driving the bus,
but it was Alice.

660
00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:12,696
Hey, you guys.

661
00:33:12,747 --> 00:33:15,866
I got something for you to see.

662
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:18,535
I was scanning through
through Kurt Dawson's video

663
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:22,139
and I noticed something strange.

664
00:33:23,575 --> 00:33:27,044
So, here, Kurt's just
wandering campus.

665
00:33:27,095 --> 00:33:29,313
Then this happens.

666
00:33:30,949 --> 00:33:32,850
Some kind of interference.

667
00:33:32,918 --> 00:33:35,402
Yeah, Kurt's receiver picked up
a signal from another camera.

668
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:37,588
I'm working on isolating
the competing image,

669
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:39,390
but in the meantime,

670
00:33:39,457 --> 00:33:40,958
I managed to pull
a few frames.

671
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:42,526
Well, those are women's shoes.

672
00:33:42,594 --> 00:33:44,094
Are we looking through
Alice's camera?

673
00:33:44,162 --> 00:33:46,630
She must have been in close
proximity to Kurt,

674
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:48,933
if his receiver picked up
her feet.

675
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,434
Where is she,
and what's she doing?

676
00:33:50,502 --> 00:33:53,404
It's hard to say.
But check this out.

677
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:57,541
What, a car stopped for her?

678
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:59,043
It looks like an old Saab.

679
00:33:59,094 --> 00:34:00,311
Hey, didn't Sara mention
something

680
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:01,378
about Dr. Aden driving

681
00:34:01,446 --> 00:34:03,814
an old dinosaur
like that?

682
00:34:19,397 --> 00:34:21,231
His car's gone.

683
00:34:21,282 --> 00:34:23,534
Well, he's smart enough
to lead us along,

684
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:25,102
maybe he knew
we were coming.

685
00:34:33,745 --> 00:34:34,778
Dr. Aden!

686
00:34:44,756 --> 00:34:46,490
Dr. Aden?!

687
00:34:46,558 --> 00:34:48,092
Hello?!

688
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:56,016
Hello?!

689
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:04,858
"Alice-- DMT-- Feb 10, 2011.

690
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:09,380
Alice-- Ketamine--
Jan 18, 2011."

691
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:10,998
They had a regular thing going.

692
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,820
This one's from yesterday.

693
00:35:19,524 --> 00:35:21,692
Can you blink, Alice?

694
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,161
Come back.

695
00:35:24,212 --> 00:35:27,114
Come back! Focus!

696
00:35:27,182 --> 00:35:28,682
Tell me everything you've seen.

697
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,518
I need to know
what you're seeing.

698
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:32,703
Let me in, Alice.

699
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:34,038
Let me in.

700
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:36,507
I'm not just your
hookah-smoking caterpillar.

701
00:35:36,574 --> 00:35:39,643
Tell me everything
you've seen!

702
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:41,678
I need to know!

703
00:35:41,746 --> 00:35:44,214
50 milligrams Tetrodotoxin,
just a mouse click away.

704
00:35:44,282 --> 00:35:46,984
Dr. Aden supplied the paralytic.

705
00:35:47,052 --> 00:35:49,186
Alice just passed it around.

706
00:35:49,254 --> 00:35:50,487
Mm-hmm.

707
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:51,789
I know you've arrived there,
Alice.

708
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:53,323
Don't leave me behind!

709
00:35:53,391 --> 00:35:55,959
Alice?!

710
00:35:57,796 --> 00:35:59,363
The video camera.

711
00:36:06,938 --> 00:36:08,505
This one's from today.

712
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:18,949
I've come to a crossroads.

713
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:23,270
The false path ends here.

714
00:36:23,354 --> 00:36:26,090
I've flirted with the precipice
for too long...

715
00:36:26,157 --> 00:36:28,776
dispatching canaries into
the celestial coal mine,

716
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,895
but shying from the descent
myself.

717
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:34,031
No longer.

718
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:40,671
I now slip not just the bonds
of mind, but of body and spirit.

719
00:36:40,738 --> 00:36:43,257
I'm ready to set sail...

720
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:45,142
unafraid.

721
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:51,748
Ithaca... I come.

722
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:05,529
You hear that?

723
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:06,997
Yeah.

724
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:12,536
Dr. Aden!

725
00:37:15,957 --> 00:37:17,958
Doctor?

726
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:28,919
A faint pupil response.

727
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:31,989
He ingested the toxin
around noon.

728
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:33,824
At his age,
depriving his brain

729
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:37,161
of oxygen for that period
of time, he's in there,

730
00:37:37,228 --> 00:37:40,464
but I doubt he'll ever find
his way back out.

731
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:42,632
What rabbit hole has Alice
fallen down?

732
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:55,829
WILLOWS
Nick, are you at the campus?

733
00:37:55,914 --> 00:37:58,148
Aden's car's parked out front.

734
00:37:58,216 --> 00:38:00,350
Campus police called it in.

735
00:38:00,418 --> 00:38:03,320
I'm, uh, checking
the building.

736
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:04,721
Copy.

737
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,068
♪ ♪

738
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:00,711
♪ ♪

739
00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:29,973
Alice?

740
00:39:45,657 --> 00:39:47,958
We've been looking for you.

741
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:50,661
I was looking for someone, too.

742
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:52,429
Your mother?

743
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:56,967
I found her!

744
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:07,778
I saw she was happy.

745
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:11,114
She told me she loved me.

746
00:40:14,952 --> 00:40:16,853
Told me to go back.

747
00:40:27,432 --> 00:40:28,532
Alice...

748
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:34,004
Where, where, where are
Kurt and Max?

749
00:40:34,072 --> 00:40:35,572
I have to tell them

750
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,574
it was everything I thought
I imagined.

751
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:38,825
I need to know

752
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,444
if they found it, too.

753
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:43,680
They're not coming back, Alice.

754
00:40:52,123 --> 00:40:56,209
Hallucinogens, neurotoxins
and sensory deprivation.

755
00:40:58,086 --> 00:41:01,676
These kids weren't <i>really</i>
venturing to the other side.

756
00:41:01,766 --> 00:41:04,901
You think they were just
inducing chemical dreams?

757
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:07,771
All their visions could be explained
by neuroscience.

758
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,606
Yeah.
Don't get me wrong.

759
00:41:09,673 --> 00:41:12,442
I'm sure Adam and Eve,
when they stood over

760
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,111
the first dead body,

761
00:41:14,178 --> 00:41:16,012
meditated on where
his soul went.

762
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,914
Humans have
always pondered

763
00:41:17,982 --> 00:41:19,416
whether there's
an afterlife.

764
00:41:19,484 --> 00:41:22,052
Yeah, if the dead could talk,
we'd all have our answers,

765
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,086
but no one's talking.

766
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:24,388
They haven't so far.

767
00:41:24,455 --> 00:41:26,189
Which leads me
to believe

768
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,025
that part of life that is death
is meant to be a mystery.

769
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:31,361
You don't sound
very scientific, Doc.

770
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:34,998
I see people on the last,
worst day of their lives.

771
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:37,868
And I'd like to believe
they go to a better place.

772
00:41:37,935 --> 00:41:40,237
I'd like to think I know you
a little better than that.

773
00:41:40,304 --> 00:41:43,774
Well, I was taught that
in Sunday school

774
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:45,375
long before medical school.

775
00:41:45,443 --> 00:41:48,845
You know what I believe?

776
00:41:48,913 --> 00:41:51,948
I believe that people that bring
suffering and pain

777
00:41:52,016 --> 00:41:53,884
into this world should have it
repaid to them

778
00:41:53,951 --> 00:41:55,986
tenfold,

779
00:41:56,053 --> 00:42:00,157
either in this world
or the next one.

780
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:02,559
Careful.

781
00:42:02,627 --> 00:42:05,996
Evil has a way of making friends
with the good

782
00:42:06,063 --> 00:42:08,265
and dragging them
into the darkness.
