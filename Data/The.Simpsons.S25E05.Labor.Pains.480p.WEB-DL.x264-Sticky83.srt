1
00:00:01,076 --> 00:00:02,576
<i>Previously on Royal Pains...</i>

2
00:00:02,578 --> 00:00:06,066
You used a new device on
a patient without consulting me.

3
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:07,401
If I consulted you,
you would have said no.

4
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:09,665
Sorry to remind you,
but I have the letters "M. D."

5
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:11,307
So I'm in charge!

6
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,243
Divya needed some money,

7
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:16,146
so I bought her shares in Hankmed.

8
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:18,445
Which means I now own 2/3rds
of the company.

9
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:21,114
- What?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:23,782
So now that I think about it...

11
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:25,316
I'm in charge.

12
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:27,984
You may want to change
the name of the company.

13
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,453
I quit.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,532
Thank you.

15
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:46,477
Mother?

16
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,678
Divya.

17
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:51,882
You look well.

18
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:55,251
As do you.

19
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:57,353
How are you doing, mommy?

20
00:00:57,355 --> 00:00:59,254
What's taking so long, Rubina?

21
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:01,890
I've been waiting over here...

22
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:06,327
Hello, father.

23
00:01:09,397 --> 00:01:10,899
I'm glad to see that Harborfest

24
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:14,236
is still a Katdare family tradition.

25
00:01:14,238 --> 00:01:15,673
Let's go.

26
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,365
Love what you've done to the place.

27
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,800
Just trying to stay organized.

28
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:44,437
This is organized?

29
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,674
This... is what you, Hank,
brought to the Hamptons.

30
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:52,145
And this was purchased
by the company, Hankmed,

31
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:53,647
which yesterday you quit.

32
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:55,749
Effective almost immediately.

33
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:56,950
Almost immediately?

34
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:59,319
Harborfest.

35
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:00,888
We have an obligation.

36
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,222
Oh, so now there's a "we. "

37
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:03,591
I see.

38
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:05,927
Well, we bought a promotional booth,

39
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:08,130
and we are sponsoring the eat-off,

40
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:09,231
which we are MC-ing.

41
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:12,135
Which you are MC-ing.

42
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:13,470
So now you're bagging out.

43
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:14,805
I was never in.

44
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:16,441
I told you that, and you ignored me,

45
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:17,775
just like you did with the smart shirts.

46
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:19,978
Oh, here we go again
with the shirts, great.

47
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,212
Evan, why would a medical practice

48
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:23,281
endorse an overeating contest?

49
00:02:23,283 --> 00:02:26,251
Okay, first of all, it is
a legitimate competitive sport.

50
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:29,755
Secondly, it's a great
opportunity to promote Hankmed

51
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:32,024
at an upscale community gathering

52
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,727
and inform people how we can help them.

53
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:38,564
I guess this just proves
how differently we see things.

54
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,532
It certainly does.

55
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:41,667
<i>I am so over Harborfest,</i>

56
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,969
and it just started this morning.

57
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:46,271
Amen to that.

58
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,377
What's up with you two?

59
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,379
And what happened to the office?

60
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,849
Divya?

61
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,350
Evan and I have reached an impasse

62
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,586
in our differences over Hankmed,

63
00:02:59,588 --> 00:03:03,323
so we've decided to...

64
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,459
suspend our partnership.

65
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:06,961
Hank quit.

66
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:08,796
No, it's not that simple.

67
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:09,863
But not to worry.

68
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:11,198
I'm gonna keep Hankmed running,

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,168
with the help of my new doctor.

70
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,938
You... you hired my replacement
within 12 hours?

71
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,940
Hm, must have been an exhaustive search.

72
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:21,309
Come on, Hank. He's not replacing you.

73
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:23,310
Actually, you know what?
He probably should.

74
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:26,714
See, I sat down with Jill last night.

75
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:28,482
What, you're gonna work at the hospital?

76
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,651
No, yesterday was her
last day, which means now

77
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:32,487
she's free to help me
set up my administration

78
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:35,323
and bookkeeping, so I can keep
doing what I've been doing...

79
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:38,694
treating patients when they
need me, where they need me.

80
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,529
Oh, you... you're gonna
do that here in the Hamptons?

81
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:41,530
Yeah.

82
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:44,500
Oh, wow, such a novel concept.

83
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:46,068
What about Harborfest?

84
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,639
Evan's got a staff now.
His new doctor can cover it.

85
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:51,508
I haven't closed his deal yet.

86
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:56,447
I'll help Hankmed
through Sunday, medically.

87
00:03:58,117 --> 00:04:01,653
So what happens on Monday?

88
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:04,690
We'll go our separate ways.

89
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:06,559
Yeah.

90
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,661
Come on, Hank.

91
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:09,862
Guess we have a lot to do by then.

92
00:04:09,864 --> 00:04:13,133
- Evan.
- Yeah, I guess we do.

93
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:15,034
Guys.

94
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,370
Gu... guys!

95
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,682
Open up, you slimy little bastard.

96
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,883
Hey, Ernie?

97
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:30,851
Need a hand?

98
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,788
I think he's just rusty.

99
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,256
My Camaro is rusty.

100
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:36,791
This guy's an embarrassment
to oyster shucking.

101
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:37,925
Hey, baby sis.

102
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:40,528
Come out here and give
your big bro a hand.

103
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,697
Baby sis is half a bushel
ahead of all you meatheads.

104
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,265
Yeah, and aunt Jill has technique.

105
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:46,299
Thanks, Luke.

106
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,768
I got your back.

107
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,103
I bet you can't wait to get to chess camp.

108
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,304
You know it.

109
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,273
Don't get me started about chess camp.

110
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,775
Your dad and your uncles

111
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:55,544
always get this way around Harborfest.

112
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,146
The new and improved Harborfest.

113
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:58,848
Don't get me started about Harborfest.

114
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,249
Don't get him started.

115
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:01,451
The thing is...

116
00:05:01,453 --> 00:05:02,519
- Too late.
- Sorry.

117
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:03,720
Everyone gather around the pulpit.

118
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:05,923
I'm just saying, okay?

119
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:09,526
Uh... uh... chain restaurants
with tasting booths?

120
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:11,762
A professional competing in the eat-off?

121
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:14,231
This thing used to be
about local fishermen.

122
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,699
- It was about the community.
- It still is.

123
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:18,034
It's good for the community.

124
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:20,569
It brings in a lot of people
and a lot of money.

125
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,371
Hello, Mcgillicuddys.

126
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,139
- Hey.
- Hey.

127
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:27,276
All right, I'm taking five.

128
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:30,445
It doesn't seem like their
standard sibling rivalry.

129
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:33,282
- We need to fix this, fast.
- I don't know.

130
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:36,620
I wouldn't get involved.
It's a family thing.

131
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:39,189
First of all, they are family to me.

132
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:42,527
And second, you got involved.

133
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:45,763
You agreed to help Hank
compete against his own brother.

134
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:47,966
Okay, I agreed to be there
for Hank as a friend,

135
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,201
setting up his business.

136
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:52,070
Just until I leave.

137
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:56,375
Divya, I don't think this is
something that you can fix.

138
00:05:56,377 --> 00:06:00,479
All right, you know those shares
that you sold to Evan?

139
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:02,482
He used them as leverage.

140
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:05,618
He did what?

141
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,387
Evan took control of Hankmed.

142
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:15,461
Well, I will let you get back
to shucking oysters.

143
00:06:15,463 --> 00:06:19,064
I'm gonna go shuck Evan.

144
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:23,203
It's not just about Harborfest.

145
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:24,938
Really? You're still talking about this?

146
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,406
The same thing's happening everywhere.

147
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:28,875
Oh, what's happening everywhere?

148
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:30,710
Good question. I'm glad you asked.

149
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:32,545
Big corporations are knocking
out the little guy.

150
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:34,881
Why the hell can't we keep one small

151
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:36,616
piece of the Hamptons to ourself?

152
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:37,750
Aah!

153
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:39,252
Mother...

154
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:42,088
Fun times at Mcgillicuddy's.

155
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,990
Okay, okay. Let me see this.

156
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:45,458
Oh...

157
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:49,762
Just keep it still, okay?

158
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:52,065
I guess I am a little rusty.

159
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:53,967
Oh.

- Mr. Berman.
- Evan.

168
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:31,145
Hi, what are you doing here?

169
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:32,780
Eh, sorry to just drop in.

170
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:35,383
I have an appointment tomorrow
to, uh, get my stitches out,

171
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:39,821
but I was in the neighborhood,
so... is Hank here?

172
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:43,291
Um, Hank doesn't work here anymore.

173
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:44,558
This isn't Hankmed anymore?

174
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,727
No, no, this... this...

175
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,895
this is the new and improved Hankmed,

176
00:07:47,897 --> 00:07:50,297
with Dr. Van Dyke, who you will love.

177
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:52,532
Well, can he see me now?

178
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:56,236
He... is not available right now.

179
00:07:56,238 --> 00:07:58,838
When will he be available?

180
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,441
I'm not sure.

181
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:04,043
Could be a while.

182
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:05,211
So, to recap...

183
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:06,679
Hankmed has no Hank.

184
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:09,048
You have a new Hank,
but he can't see me now,

185
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,384
or anytime soon.

186
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:13,853
Mr. Berman, uh, have a seat.

187
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:18,657
We can discuss discounting your retainer.

188
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,725
Big discount.

189
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:24,662
And I'll throw in an additional
executive physical.

190
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:28,767
And I have a... a... an assortment

191
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,603
of complimentary Hankmed sundries for you.

192
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:32,605
This is a first aid kit.

193
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:34,407
Uh, flavored antacids, grape and cherry.

194
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,410
Tastes like childhood, really.

195
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:39,447
And, uh, oh, my God,
I have enough hand sanitizer...

196
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:41,549
you could literally take a bath in it.

197
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:44,352
Hand sanitizer.

198
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:45,953
That's lovely.

199
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:48,923
Why don't you use it to wash
your hands of my retainer?

200
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:15,149
He's lucky the knife hit
the back of his hand.

201
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:17,452
The tendon in his palm would
have meant the hospital.

202
00:09:17,454 --> 00:09:18,953
We lost our hookup with that place.

203
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:21,956
Maybe I should cancel chess camp.

204
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,625
Oh, no. Your bus leaves
in a couple of hours.

205
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:25,093
My dad needs me.

206
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:26,461
No, I'll be fine.

207
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:28,263
Look, you know how
I feel about chess camp.

208
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:30,131
So, I'm not saying go.

209
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:31,800
But I am saying,
don't miss it because of me.

210
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:33,502
I'm saying both.

211
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:35,437
Luke, this is a great opportunity for you.

212
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:37,272
Yeah, but I'm also gonna miss Harborfest.

213
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:38,440
Hm.

214
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:39,807
Okay, you got your shot of rocephin,

215
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:41,242
your tetanus is up to date.

216
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:43,211
Some antibiotics, and you're good.

217
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:45,880
Well, there'll be other Harborfests.

218
00:09:45,882 --> 00:09:48,015
Besides, your aunt Jill's
gonna miss the next

219
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:50,251
one or two herself.

220
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,653
Thanks for offering, kiddo.
You're a good man.

221
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:53,854
You're a good man too, Hank.

222
00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:56,457
I need your help, come on.

223
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:02,330
Evan, hey.

224
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:03,697
Uh, can we talk for a minute?

225
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:06,767
Uh, talk fast. I'm short-staffed.

226
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,034
Everything we discussed last night.

227
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:09,669
A cut of all retainers I bring in?

228
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:11,504
It's all in here, 5%.

229
00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:13,739
Eesh, I was hoping for 15%.

230
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,941
Wha... uh, I was hoping for
"Jersey Shore: The Movie. "

231
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:17,543
Life's full of disappointments.

232
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:19,010
Okay. Make it 10%,

233
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:21,713
and you've got yourself
a concierge doctor.

234
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,821
I would have settled for 5.

235
00:10:28,823 --> 00:10:30,556
I would have paid 15.

236
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:33,526
Hm.

237
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:35,028
So, I can give you ten hours a week.

238
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,697
Whoa, what?

239
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:38,132
Dude, I need you 24/7.

240
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:40,100
Aw, sorry, bud.

241
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:43,204
Can't get a full-time doctor
with part-time money.

242
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:45,640
Life's full of disappointments, huh?

243
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:52,780
It's me, again.

244
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:54,882
I know that you are busy,

245
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:57,584
but please call me.

246
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:06,192
Ms. Novak?

247
00:11:09,165 --> 00:11:11,365
Sorry to interrupt your... lunch?

248
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,834
A three hour eat-a-thon.

249
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:14,469
It's my training for the competition.

250
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:15,637
Of course.

251
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,072
Well, how is it going?

252
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:20,443
Great, except for the nausea
and vomiting I called you about.

253
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,211
I can't imagine what's causing it.

254
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,280
I never get sick when
I'm training or competing.

255
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:25,615
It's very strange.

256
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:28,184
So you have been blessed
with a petite figure,

257
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,553
and an iron stomach.

258
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:33,522
How many lobster rolls
can you eat in ten minutes?

259
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,591
- 47.
- Get out!

260
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:36,791
But that will go down

261
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:38,626
if I keep losing it during training.

262
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:40,461
I may be competing against amateurs,

263
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:42,496
but I take nothing for granted.

264
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:44,231
Plus, I don't want to let down my sponsor,

265
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:45,766
who rented me this house.

266
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:46,834
But I'm more concerned with why

267
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,803
you're experiencing these symptoms.

268
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:50,538
Yeah, that too.

269
00:11:52,574 --> 00:11:56,210
Your gall bladder
and your appendix look fine.

270
00:11:56,212 --> 00:11:58,179
So, what does that mean?

271
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:01,784
It means that a full G.I. workup is next.

272
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:04,053
Can we do that after my next meal?

273
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:06,388
On the contrary,
you'll need to fast for a bit,

274
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,924
considering your lunch portions.

275
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,725
Then go right to the hospital.

276
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:10,694
That will interrupt my training.

277
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,229
I can't interrupt my training.

278
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:16,534
Rosie, the way that you eat is
an invitation to gastroparesis.

279
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:17,968
What's that?

280
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,738
It's a form of stomach paralysis.

281
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,374
That wouldn't be good for me.

282
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:25,410
The accumulation of food could
cause an obstruction,

283
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,178
possible perforation,

284
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,313
and that would interrupt your training

285
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,315
and a whole lot more, permanently.

286
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,420
Great, I'll text you the address.

287
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,455
Awesome, see you then.

288
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:16,326
Did you buy my shares
to use them against Hank?

289
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,828
What?

290
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,196
How could you think that?

291
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,765
One, you bought my shares.

292
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,267
Two, you used them against Hank.

293
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,869
I see how you could think that.

294
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,670
Why did you buy my shares?

295
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,872
To help you. Divya, I swear.

296
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,374
It was not premeditated.

297
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:34,610
Hank... we were fighting.

298
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:38,180
I just wanted him to take
me seriously, for once.

299
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:42,884
So, I used whatever I had at my disposal.

300
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:45,753
Can you imagine how he took it?

301
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:48,523
Maybe it was not the best approach.

302
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:51,092
Oh, Evan.

303
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:54,529
You believe me, though.

304
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:58,465
Being vengeful didn't
really sound like you.

305
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:02,369
Acting impulsively, ah, textbook you.

306
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:05,473
Of course I believe you.

307
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:07,508
Hank will too.

308
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,848
Hey. Thanks for coming back out.

309
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,350
Yeah, of course. What's up with Ernie?

310
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:15,518
You know, I'm...

311
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,053
I'm sure it's nothing,

312
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:19,156
but he just seems a little off.

313
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,858
He's got a terrible headache,
and, of course,

314
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,027
he refuses to let me take his temperature.

315
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,162
Ernie, come on, can I help
you with that, please?

316
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,563
I'm good, Jill.

317
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,333
I don't need a helper,
and I don't need a doctor.

318
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,535
Uh, yeah, uh, actually, Ernie,
I came to check on your cast

319
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:34,637
and make sure you don't have
any tenderness in your hand.

320
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,573
Hand good. Cast good.

321
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,708
- All good.
- Uh, okay.

322
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,109
Any other issues?

323
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:43,879
Well, I have, uh, three younger siblings,

324
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:46,716
an ex-wife, and a teenage son.

325
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:47,984
Can you narrow it down a bit?

326
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:49,952
Wooziness, fever, headache?

327
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:51,354
Little bit of a headache.

328
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:52,823
So what?

329
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,925
I just need to make sure
it's not connected to your hand.

330
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,928
No, I think it's, uh, more
connected to this conversation.

331
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,597
So I'm gonna go get myself an advil.

332
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,700
- Excuse me.
- Uh, okay.

333
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,802
Hey, if you see Luke anywhere,
send him to the kitchen.

334
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,603
He needs to man the fryer.

335
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,106
I thought Luke left for chess camp.

336
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,340
He did.

337
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:15,311
He put him on the bus himself an hour ago.

338
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:20,468
Is all this really necessary?

339
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,637
When I checked your eyes,
I found swelling that indicates

340
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,906
increased intracranial pressure.

341
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:27,609
Plus, you forgot Luke left.

342
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:29,411
So, yes. It's necessary.

343
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:31,714
I'm a little stressed out, that's all.

344
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:32,982
Okay, the C.T. is clean.

345
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:34,850
So, can I get back to the pier?

346
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,920
Because Harborfest isn't gonna
wait for intracranial pressure.

347
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:39,154
Sure, right after a spinal tap.

348
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:40,189
Are you serious?

349
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:41,490
I need to rule out encephalitis.

350
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:43,225
How long will that take?

351
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:45,393
Ernie, he's gonna put
a needle in your spine,

352
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:48,496
so, let's focus on precision, not speed.

353
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:49,930
Have you met my sister, Jill?

354
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,899
She's the one always wanting
to take care of everyone...

355
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:52,966
- Uh-huh.
- And everything.

356
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,235
And Ernie's lucky to have her.

357
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:56,437
Next thing Ernie knows,

358
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:57,805
she'll make him go to chess camp.

359
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:00,007
Luke's a genius. He wanted to go.

360
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:01,943
He worships you. He always has.

361
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:03,712
So, if aunt Jill is going on vacation,

362
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,247
now, of course, Luke wants one too.

363
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:07,816
Hank will just wait until
you guys finish talking

364
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:10,019
before he sticks a needle
in Ernie's spine.

365
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:12,755
I'm just gonna prep the anesthetic.

366
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:13,756
Okay.

367
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:17,927
You're gonna feel a little pinch.

368
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:21,830
Ernie, I'm not going on a vacation.

369
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:24,832
I'm moving on to the next
chapter in my life,

370
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:28,302
and I don't know how many
Harborfests I'm going to miss,

371
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:30,704
but it'll be more than one or two.

372
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:31,972
I know that for sure.

373
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:34,041
I bet you're home by Christmas.

374
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,710
Well, that would pose a problem.

375
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:38,813
Okay, Ernie. Here we go.

376
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:44,752
I accepted an offer
on my home this morning.

377
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,156
You will feel pressure.

378
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:50,158
Look, Ernie. It's gonna be okay.

379
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,359
I promise.

380
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:53,595
Everything will.

381
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:04,175
Okay.

382
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:08,313
Champagne tap.

383
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:09,514
There's champagne in there?

384
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,183
'Cause I'm more of a beer guy myself.

385
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:12,885
Uh, no, that just means it's clear,

386
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:15,054
but I still don't know what's
causing the swelling.

387
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:16,788
So, now what?

388
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,658
We get the fluid to Hamptons
Heritage for a closer look.

389
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,860
Okay, I'll put a rush on it.

390
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,595
Um...

391
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:24,229
What? A little faith, please.

392
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:26,164
I can still pull
a string or two over there.

393
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,733
Okay.

394
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:29,601
Tell me about yourself, Dr. Lewis.

395
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:31,436
Tell me about yourself, Dr. Reiner.

396
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:33,705
So, Dr. Rikestyne,

397
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,207
do you have any E.R. experience?

398
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:38,276
I wouldn't say "E. R. experience," per se,

399
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:42,881
but my endoscopic work
is quite impressive.

400
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:44,582
Are you a resourceful man?

401
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:49,854
Well, I always keep a standard
issue first aid kit in my trunk.

402
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:52,590
Just out of curiosity, how
long will this interview take?

403
00:17:52,592 --> 00:17:54,025
I have a 7:00 reservation

404
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:56,227
at Nick and Toni's,
and my wife just called.

405
00:17:56,229 --> 00:17:58,262
I have to pick her up at the spa.

406
00:17:58,264 --> 00:18:01,031
You would be amazed at what you can find

407
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:03,334
in the depths of a small intestine.

408
00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:07,939
So, uh, thanks for coming,

409
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:10,074
Dr. Sacani...

410
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:13,912
Wow.

411
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:16,014
Impressive. So you know

412
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:18,283
this is not just like a breezy summer gig.

413
00:18:18,285 --> 00:18:20,885
This is, like... it would be...

414
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:22,787
your life.

415
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:24,723
You know, two out
of every hundred Americans

416
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:26,024
are allergic to shellfish, and notably,

417
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:29,594
the cross-reactivity molecules
that are responsible

418
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:31,296
for the allergies in crustaceans

419
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:34,232
are also responsible
for cockroach allergies.

420
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:36,467
I did... I didn't know that.
That's... that's, uh...

421
00:18:36,469 --> 00:18:41,172
I'm sorry, uh,
you were asking me something.

422
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:44,075
I was just saying,
this is more than just a job.

423
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:45,877
It would be your whole life, basically.

424
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:47,312
I don't have much of a life.

425
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:49,747
My therapist thought concierge
medicine would, uh,

426
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:54,919
help me confront
some of my social deficits.

427
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:58,689
Um, thank you for coming, Dr. Sacani.

428
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:01,057
Oh, uh, you'll be in touch?

429
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:05,929
You know, to be completely
honest with you,

430
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:08,599
you're not exactly what I'm looking for.

431
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:10,868
So, but...

432
00:19:24,982 --> 00:19:27,349
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

433
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:28,684
I appreciate you meeting me here.

434
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,120
Yeah, of course.

435
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:32,754
Uh, I got your email about Rosie.

436
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,756
The scan's a good call.

437
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,359
Yeah, I'm... I'm so curious
to see what they find in there.

438
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:39,728
You wouldn't believe how she trains.

439
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,431
Chicken wings by the dozen,
I mean, water by the gallon.

440
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:45,201
I gained five pounds just watching her.

441
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,903
So she has to drink a lot of water

442
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:48,338
to wash down all that food?

443
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,406
Yeah, and to stretch her stomach.

444
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:50,907
Right.

445
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:56,346
Uh, what's this?

446
00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:59,383
It's a loan application, from the bank.

447
00:19:59,385 --> 00:20:04,988
Evan buying my shares had
nothing to do with leverage.

448
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,923
Nothing to do with you.

449
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:08,724
He did it to help me.

450
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:12,494
So, uh, I want to take
the shares out of the equation.

451
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:16,499
Divya, it's bigger than the shares.

452
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:18,434
He and I have philosophical differences

453
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:21,404
over what Hankmed should be.

454
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:23,940
Beneath those differences

455
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:26,376
are two brothers who love each other.

456
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:28,779
You're just too mad to see it.

457
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:30,214
Talk to him, Hank.

458
00:20:36,622 --> 00:20:38,088
Nice view.

459
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,057
What are you doing here?

460
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,959
I had a hunch I should check on you,

461
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:43,426
see how you're feeling.

462
00:20:43,428 --> 00:20:45,562
I'm fine. Just a stomachache.

463
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:46,763
- Headache's gone, though.
- Uh-huh.

464
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:48,264
What are you drinking there, Ernie?

465
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:50,065
Don't worry, it's just water.

466
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,900
That's exactly why I worried.

467
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:56,270
Cramping, to go along with
your confusion, and spasming.

468
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:58,773
You're competing in the eat-off,
aren't you?

469
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:00,441
Damn straight, I am.

470
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:02,043
Enough's enough.

471
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:04,278
I'm not gonna let a pro take that trophy.

472
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,746
So I'm gonna eat 1 or maybe 40

473
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,448
for the little guy.

474
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,617
And how much have you been
drinking for the little guy?

475
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,619
A few gallons here, a few there.

476
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:13,987
Polydipsia.

477
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:16,523
You overwhelmed your kidneys
to the point of toxicity.

478
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,858
If you keep it up, the increased
pressure in your skull

479
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,359
could cause your brain to herniate,

480
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:22,461
- which could ultimately be fatal.
- From water?

481
00:21:22,463 --> 00:21:23,929
Too much of anything can hurt you.

482
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:25,297
The problem didn't start
in your head, Ernie,

483
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:27,332
it started in your stomach.

484
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,935
Cut back to normal consumption,
and you should be okay.

485
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:34,206
I'm sure you'll win
the eat-off next summer.

486
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:37,976
Good news.

487
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:41,948
No gastroparesis, no ulcers,

488
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,849
and no obstruction.

489
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:44,851
Oh!

490
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:47,353
Rosie?

491
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:49,022
Rosie, what happened?

492
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:50,556
I have no idea.

493
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:52,225
Okay, lie down.

494
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:00,934
I've been doing some homework
on competitive eating.

495
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:03,269
It can lead to glucose swings.

496
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:04,537
I guess that makes sense.

497
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:08,774
I need to check your levels, okay?

498
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:11,443
Hey, Rosie, what made you decide to become

499
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:13,512
a full-time competitive eater?

500
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:17,683
I... I only ask because it seems to attract

501
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:20,018
so many different types of people.

502
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,022
I was reading that one person
at the eat-off is a policeman

503
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:28,093
and one is a realtor.

504
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:29,462
You all right?

505
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:32,197
Yes, I'm feeling much better now.

506
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,832
Oh, good.

507
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,902
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

508
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:39,038
I just asked you what made you choose

509
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,906
competitive eating as a career.

510
00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:44,577
Oh, um, the restaurant...

511
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:47,613
I hated waiting tables at hated me back.

512
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:50,115
It's gonna pinch.

513
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:54,653
I was a terrible waitress. A major klutz.

514
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:58,323
But then I discovered this talent.

515
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:00,993
It's a crazy thing to call it,
I know, but,

516
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:03,796
when you suck at almost all you do,

517
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:06,431
and then you find something
you're good at,

518
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:09,401
really good at, it changes everything.

519
00:23:09,403 --> 00:23:11,603
The magical power of food.

520
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:15,607
There's no escape like a big meal.

521
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:19,245
You might be right about that.

522
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,547
Your glucose level is fine.

523
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:23,750
So I can compete.

524
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:25,285
I have no medical grounds

525
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:28,456
for pulling you out of the competition.

526
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,493
And I will be there
if you need me for anything.

527
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:40,035
Voila.

528
00:23:40,037 --> 00:23:42,171
Harborfest comes home.

529
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:43,172
Wow.

530
00:23:43,174 --> 00:23:45,074
You really are harbor-festive.

531
00:23:45,076 --> 00:23:47,209
There's no escape like a good meal.

532
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:50,179
I could get used to this.

533
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:51,648
I think that's a great idea, Evan.

534
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:55,651
We should make family dinner
a weekly thing.

535
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:57,486
To Harborfest,

536
00:23:57,488 --> 00:24:00,155
and to family.

537
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:09,099
Okay, Divya, this is noble of you...

538
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:11,502
Hank, you know that Evan gets upset

539
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:13,104
when you dismiss his ideas.

540
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:16,474
Evan, you know that Hank gets upset

541
00:24:16,476 --> 00:24:19,744
when you push your ideas first,
ask how he feels second,

542
00:24:19,746 --> 00:24:23,448
and ignore how he feels third.

543
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,816
You guys are family,

544
00:24:24,818 --> 00:24:28,019
to each other, and to me.

545
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:31,189
So I am begging you, please...

546
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:33,558
Get past the anger
and have a conversation,

547
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,429
like adults.

548
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:39,198
Okay. Can I start?

549
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,600
Yes, please.

550
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:43,735
- Henry...
- Evan.

551
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:48,273
You did dismiss my idea
about embracing technology,

552
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:50,642
and it did upset me.

553
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,015
To be fair, you can't say
your idea was dismissed,

554
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:58,884
since you went ahead
and ran with it anyway.

555
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:00,019
Okay, good, great.

556
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:02,054
- So, now we can just...
- I'm sorry,

557
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:04,323
what was my alternative?
Uh, wait a few years

558
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:05,892
until you gave me your blessing?

559
00:25:05,894 --> 00:25:08,361
I'm ambitious, Hank.
It can be useful at times.

560
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:09,763
I'm careful.

561
00:25:09,765 --> 00:25:12,165
That can be useful too,
you know, in a medical practice.

562
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,333
Wow, why do you say that like I think

563
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:14,601
we're running a Hooters franchise?

564
00:25:14,603 --> 00:25:16,102
- Well, if the shoe fits...
- Okay, guys, please.

565
00:25:16,104 --> 00:25:18,939
Honestly, I... Evan, I really
don't think that he meant that.

566
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:20,941
Yes, Divya, I did.

567
00:25:20,943 --> 00:25:22,609
We focus on people first, profit second.

568
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:24,445
That's the only type
of Hankmed I'm interested in.

569
00:25:24,447 --> 00:25:25,679
Well, then I guess we're
right back where we started.

570
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:27,715
- Guys, please...
- You mean back where we ended.

571
00:25:27,717 --> 00:25:29,316
- No. No, no, no... wait...
- There he goes again.

572
00:25:29,318 --> 00:25:30,718
He always needs the last word.

573
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,686
Well, guess what, Henry?
This time, you can have it.

574
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:34,721
- You can have it.
- Technically, you had it,

575
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:36,556
since you were just talking, for a change.

576
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:37,925
- And now you're talking.
- You are!

577
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:39,260
- You're talking!
- Listen! It's your voice!

578
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:40,527
- Oh, my God...
- That's all I'm hearing,

579
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:41,995
- your voice.
- Oh, my God...

580
00:25:41,997 --> 00:25:43,564
listen, what's that sound?
It's Evan talking!

581
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:44,999
It doesn't even matter!

582
00:25:57,746 --> 00:25:59,846
Mr. Berman stopped by yesterday?

583
00:25:59,848 --> 00:26:01,180
He did.

584
00:26:01,182 --> 00:26:04,016
- Why didn't you tell me?
- When?

585
00:26:04,018 --> 00:26:06,586
Last night, over our quaint
little family dinner?

586
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:07,921
Whether we're fighting or not,

587
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:09,957
you have to inform me
when my patient comes...

588
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,825
You mean your patient that I landed?

589
00:26:11,827 --> 00:26:15,196
By bringing his wife tulips and
orchids every day for six weeks

590
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,632
just to secure his business?

591
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:20,635
Eh, I guess to you that was just
another one of my zany schemes,

592
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:22,804
- wasn't it?
- Where's his file?

593
00:26:25,007 --> 00:26:28,510
- It's on the table.
- Thank you.

594
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:36,084
Dude, what are you doing?

595
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:38,686
What is this?

596
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:40,988
Private communication between
me and my fiancee.

597
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,222
Yeah, about me.

598
00:26:42,224 --> 00:26:43,690
So?

599
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:46,159
You want a royalty payment?

600
00:26:46,161 --> 00:26:48,529
How could you call me a quitter?

601
00:26:48,531 --> 00:26:50,064
How could I call you... hm, let's see.

602
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,100
Because you quit.

603
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:56,372
Things got tough, you walked away.

604
00:26:56,374 --> 00:27:00,610
Guess you got that move from dad.

605
00:27:00,612 --> 00:27:03,413
If that's how you feel,

606
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:06,116
maybe ending our partnership isn't enough.

607
00:27:06,118 --> 00:27:08,652
Right? I mean...

608
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:13,723
I can't imagine you want
to live with a quitter.

609
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:16,125
Guess we've got a lot
to figure out before Monday.

610
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:19,896
Yeah. I guess we do.

611
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:33,709
Uh...

612
00:27:33,711 --> 00:27:35,210
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

613
00:27:35,212 --> 00:27:37,746
My name is Evan R. Lawson,

614
00:27:37,748 --> 00:27:38,948
and I will be your color commentator

615
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,916
for this year's Hamptons
Harborfest eat-off.

616
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:42,684
Which is... yes, that's... yes!

617
00:27:42,686 --> 00:27:43,885
That's good.

618
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:46,355
Are you guys ready
to meet your contestants?

619
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,792
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

620
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:50,993
Are you ready to meet your contestants?

621
00:27:50,995 --> 00:27:53,263
Contestants, come on out!

622
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:55,432
Hey, Divya. Have you seen Ernie around?

623
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:57,734
No one at the restaurant
knows where he is.

624
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,740
He didn't pull out of the contest?

625
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:05,542
Well, if he did, he has very good seats.

626
00:28:05,544 --> 00:28:07,311
Ernie. Ernie!

627
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:09,413
Can I talk to you for a second?

628
00:28:12,884 --> 00:28:14,184
I need to do this, Hank.

629
00:28:14,186 --> 00:28:16,419
I thought I specifically
told you not to do this.

630
00:28:16,421 --> 00:28:17,620
Look, everything's changing.

631
00:28:17,622 --> 00:28:19,155
My son's gone, my sister's leaving,

632
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,056
my job's not too far behind.

633
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:24,459
I've been to every Harborfest
every year since I was born.

634
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:25,727
And they're gonna change that too.

635
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,596
I need this, Hank.

636
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:30,633
For my community, yeah,
but more for myself.

637
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:33,970
This contest has always been won
by a local,

638
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:36,072
and something around here has got to stay

639
00:28:36,074 --> 00:28:38,609
the way it should be.

640
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:39,877
Mm-hm?

641
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:41,145
How much water have you had today?

642
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:43,614
A glass, with breakfast.

643
00:28:46,318 --> 00:28:48,152
Open your eyes, look over my shoulder.

644
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:52,690
Okay, now over this shoulder.

645
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:55,058
Okay.

646
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,494
Deep breath, in and out.

647
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,164
So?

648
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,166
Thanks to the spinal tap,
and the fact that you finally

649
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:05,734
gave your kidneys a break?

650
00:29:05,736 --> 00:29:07,069
You dodged a bullet, my friend.

651
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:09,439
All right, so?

652
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:10,607
Eat your heart out, Mcgillicuddy.

653
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:12,775
Thanks, doc.

654
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:15,178
Okay, guys, all right.
Ladies and gentlemen,

655
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,879
the eaters have taken their spots.

656
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,681
Are you guys ready? Thumbs up, please.

657
00:29:18,683 --> 00:29:20,650
Ladies and gentlemen, on the count of

658
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:23,052
five... four...

659
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:25,422
three... two...

660
00:29:25,424 --> 00:29:26,489
one...

661
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:28,324
eat!

662
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:30,692
They are off, ladies and gentlemen.

663
00:29:30,694 --> 00:29:32,227
Look at them go!

664
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,529
Early on, Rosie "The Ravenous"
is choking down her first one.

665
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:37,999
"Munchy" Mcgillicuddy already
has two down the hatch.

666
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:40,135
I'm sensing something
very personal here, guys.

667
00:29:40,137 --> 00:29:42,203
She is chomping them down.

668
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:44,205
Rosie "The Ravenous" looking very good

669
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:45,806
at this halfway point.

670
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:47,108
And, oh, my God,

671
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,311
Jeff "The Vacuum Cleaner"
Darland, slowing down.

672
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:52,881
Look at Rosie "The Ravenous"
put away number 37.

673
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:55,917
"Munchy" Mcgillicuddy right behind her.

674
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,453
This is insanity!

675
00:29:57,455 --> 00:29:58,855
It's insanity.

676
00:29:58,857 --> 00:30:02,058
Over here we've got
"The Regurgitator" and T-Bone.

677
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,495
Novak and Mcgillicuddy, near the wire.

678
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:06,897
Oh, they are looking eyes.

679
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,498
I mean, it's Novak.

680
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,633
It's Mcgillicuddy.

681
00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:11,601
It's Novak again!

682
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:12,902
And as time expires...

683
00:30:12,904 --> 00:30:15,238
It's a tie!

684
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,372
What?

685
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:18,007
I don't know what that means,

686
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:19,909
so I'm gonna go and ask my referees,

687
00:30:19,911 --> 00:30:21,744
'cause I have no idea
what to do right now.

688
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:28,083
Okay. I've just been informed...

689
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:29,418
after a short break,

690
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,856
Novak and Mcgillicuddy
will go into sudden death.

691
00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:38,294
Which means,
whoever eats five lobster rolls

692
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:41,297
the fastest will
be crowned Harborfest champ.

693
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,900
Let's just give them a breather right now.

694
00:30:43,902 --> 00:30:45,301
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm just gonna ask you guys.

695
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:46,469
Who do you think is gonna win this?

696
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:50,473
Is it gonna be the girl from Grand Rapids?

697
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:55,478
Or the boy from Bridgehampton?

698
00:30:59,717 --> 00:31:00,782
I'm not sure, it's a little unclear.

699
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:02,484
- Let's just do that again.
- Evan.

700
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,986
Will it be the girl from Grand Rapids?

701
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,387
Evan!

702
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:06,654
Uh, one moment.

703
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,689
Are you kidding me? What are you doing?

704
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:08,723
Do you do this at the opera house?

705
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:09,891
I'm putting on a show right now.

706
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:12,060
Okay, and I'm trying to help a patient.

707
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:15,029
Why did you say that Rosie
was from Michigan?

708
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:16,297
I don't know. Because she's from Michigan.

709
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:17,899
No. No, no, no. She's European.

710
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:19,901
Competitive eaters
often adopt a stage persona,

711
00:31:19,903 --> 00:31:21,102
like pro wrestlers.

712
00:31:21,104 --> 00:31:22,370
It's all marketing and intimidation.

713
00:31:22,372 --> 00:31:23,805
That doesn't make any sense.

714
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:25,774
I saw interviews with her
online, during my research

715
00:31:25,776 --> 00:31:27,576
in which she spoke about
her childhood in Michigan

716
00:31:27,578 --> 00:31:28,977
in an American accent.

717
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:30,479
I'm telling you, it's just
theater, it's just that.

718
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:31,847
Well, then why has she
been using her accent

719
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:32,948
with me in private?

720
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,917
Maybe she stays in character.

721
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:36,218
Maybe she heard you speak and thought

722
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,353
you were challenging her.

723
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:39,288
She is competitive.

724
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,890
It's not gastro.

725
00:31:40,892 --> 00:31:42,191
It's neuro.

726
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:43,492
It's what?

727
00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:45,160
Divya, can I get back to my fans

728
00:31:45,162 --> 00:31:46,461
and potential clients now, please?

729
00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:50,765
No. Go find Hank, fast!

730
00:32:11,352 --> 00:32:12,986
Hey, Rosie.

731
00:32:12,988 --> 00:32:14,054
Hey.

732
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:15,088
Are you feeling all right?

733
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,391
I feel fine, just a little full.

734
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,260
Rosie, tell me about your accent.

735
00:32:20,262 --> 00:32:24,531
What accent? I'm sorry, I need to focus.

736
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:26,767
- Hey, what's up with Rosie?
- Hey.

737
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:28,168
Her speech may be distorted.

738
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,236
I think the problem isn't in her stomach.

739
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:32,639
I think it's in her head.

740
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:35,442
Okay, let's do an exam.

741
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:38,212
Yup, I hear a bruit.

742
00:32:38,214 --> 00:32:39,413
Nice catch.

743
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,315
What's a bruit? What'd she catch?

744
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:43,818
You may well have a dissection
of the carotid artery,

745
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,953
which could lead to stroke-like symptoms,

746
00:32:45,955 --> 00:32:47,488
including altered speech patterns.

747
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,626
Why does everyone keep talking
about the way I'm talking?

748
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:52,361
Wait a second, so it's not
just marketing and intimidation?

749
00:32:52,363 --> 00:32:54,396
You're speaking with an accent.

750
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:55,998
I'm not speaking with an accent.

751
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,167
I don't even have a Michigan accent.

752
00:32:58,169 --> 00:32:59,902
If I may enter exhibit "A."

753
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,671
I'm not speaking with an accent.

754
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:03,840
I don't even have a Michigan accent.

755
00:33:03,842 --> 00:33:06,009
For what it's worth, I still
find it very intimidating.

756
00:33:06,011 --> 00:33:07,143
Like, in a good way.

757
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:09,344
Oh, my God. What's wrong with me?

758
00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:11,713
The carotid dissection is
throwing off little blood clots,

759
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:13,815
which can cause nausea,
vomiting, and these

760
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,883
odd speech changes, which are referred to

761
00:33:15,885 --> 00:33:17,651
as foreign accent syndrome.

762
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:19,787
Why can't I hear the accent?

763
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,489
Sometimes that's actually
part of the syndrome.

764
00:33:21,491 --> 00:33:23,091
Will I be okay?

765
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:25,526
A magnetic resonance angiogram
will confirm the dissection.

766
00:33:25,528 --> 00:33:28,062
Anti-coagulants will treat the symptoms

767
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,663
and prevent further damage,

768
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:31,999
but we've got to get you to the hospital.

769
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:33,834
I can't forfeit a contest.

770
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:37,671
I... I told you how far
I've come to get here.

771
00:33:37,673 --> 00:33:39,606
Maybe not from where
you thought, but trust me,

772
00:33:39,608 --> 00:33:41,041
it's been a long road.

773
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:44,277
This is my livelihood,
and it's all I have.

774
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,179
I can't just walk away.

775
00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:49,482
Can't I wait until
right after the contest?

776
00:33:49,484 --> 00:33:50,650
Sorry, Rosie.

777
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:54,053
Can't wait.

778
00:33:54,055 --> 00:33:57,355
Um, I really have to go
and make it official.

779
00:33:57,357 --> 00:33:58,790
Sorry.

780
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:00,592
Wait, wait, wait.

781
00:34:02,895 --> 00:34:05,495
May I give it to him?

782
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:16,543
Well, what a lucky turn of events.

783
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:17,744
How so?

784
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:19,412
Well, if I hadn't done my homework,

785
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:20,947
I wouldn't have heard Rosie's real voice,

786
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,849
and you guys wouldn't have
made the diagnosis.

787
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,250
And as a bonus,

788
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:26,752
the Hankmed new client sign-up
sheet's completely full.

789
00:34:26,754 --> 00:34:29,555
So, I'm glad I followed
my gut about MC-ing, too.

790
00:34:29,557 --> 00:34:31,723
I gotta hand it to you, Ev.

791
00:34:31,725 --> 00:34:32,991
You're truly gifted.

792
00:34:32,993 --> 00:34:37,662
You've got the ability to sell anything.

793
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:40,131
I'm happy for you.

794
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:41,800
And without being tied to me,

795
00:34:41,802 --> 00:34:43,735
you can finally flourish,

796
00:34:43,737 --> 00:34:45,804
wherever your gift takes you,

797
00:34:45,806 --> 00:34:49,609
whoever you choose to grace with it.

798
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,797
Thanks for coming.

799
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:13,132
- Sure.
- Sure.

800
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,567
How you doing, man? Paul Van Dyke.

801
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,137
Okay.

802
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:19,972
Evan, I didn't realize you already

803
00:35:19,974 --> 00:35:23,508
went ahead and hired me an associate.

804
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,611
Must have been an exhaustive search.

805
00:35:26,613 --> 00:35:28,113
Well, uh, I will be compensating for your

806
00:35:28,115 --> 00:35:31,049
part-time availability
with Dr. Sacani here.

807
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:32,684
Oh, I see you use a motorcycle

808
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:34,819
for practical transportation.

809
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:36,287
A, uh, Nintendo engineer

810
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:38,322
studied middle-aged Japanese
men, and he discovered that

811
00:35:38,324 --> 00:35:39,924
the ones that commuted by motorcycle

812
00:35:39,926 --> 00:35:42,159
demonstrated greater
cognitive functioning.

813
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:44,862
And I'll be compensating
for his lack of concierge charm

814
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:48,099
with my own.
Together, we can make this work.

815
00:35:48,101 --> 00:35:50,202
Any questions so far?

816
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:55,106
Yes, Dr. Sacani?

817
00:35:55,108 --> 00:35:59,177
Um, I thought I wasn't
what you were looking for.

818
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:03,081
Uh, turns out I was looking
for the wrong thing, actually.

819
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:08,120
I was clinging to my past,
instead of creating my future.

820
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:09,455
Oh.

821
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:10,623
Okay.

822
00:36:16,596 --> 00:36:18,230
Good night.

823
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:23,804
Raj?

824
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,671
Divya.

825
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:27,106
Surprised you're not at Harborfest.

826
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:28,308
Oh, I'm heading there now.

827
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,509
Just finishing with a patient.

828
00:36:29,511 --> 00:36:30,844
Of course.

829
00:36:30,846 --> 00:36:31,978
Well, what are you doing here?

830
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,079
Is everything okay?

831
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:34,915
Yes, everything is fine.

832
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:36,316
How are you? How are your parents?

833
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:38,085
Everything is great.

834
00:36:38,087 --> 00:36:39,419
We're all great.

835
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:41,755
And you?

836
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:45,092
Divya, you remember Karen?

837
00:36:45,094 --> 00:36:46,727
Yes, of course. How are you?

838
00:36:46,729 --> 00:36:48,862
Okay.

839
00:36:48,864 --> 00:36:50,997
Just a little... you know.

840
00:36:53,335 --> 00:36:54,902
Raj, you didn't tell her.

841
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:56,404
I was about to.

842
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:59,874
Karen's doctor just made it official.

843
00:37:01,476 --> 00:37:03,044
Congratulations.

844
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:04,345
Oh, to both of you.

845
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,914
Thank you.

846
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:09,951
Excuse me, I'm gonna go call my parents.

847
00:37:09,953 --> 00:37:11,186
Okay.

848
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:15,591
Wow.

849
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:17,226
You are gonna be a...

850
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:18,862
By next summer, yes.

851
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:21,564
We'll be a family.

852
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:24,033
I'm thrilled for you, Raj.

853
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:27,103
But I do hope that your parents
are going to take it

854
00:37:27,105 --> 00:37:28,104
as well as hers.

855
00:37:28,106 --> 00:37:29,439
I already told them.

856
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:30,974
They were certainly shocked at first,

857
00:37:30,976 --> 00:37:34,243
but we're talking our way
through it, and now

858
00:37:34,245 --> 00:37:38,747
they're just embracing
the idea of a grandchild.

859
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:44,420
Well, it was really nice to see you.

860
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:46,855
Good-bye, Divya.

861
00:37:46,857 --> 00:37:48,490
Good-bye, Raj.

862
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:53,196
Hey.

863
00:37:53,198 --> 00:37:54,331
Good luck.

864
00:38:11,378 --> 00:38:13,411
- Hey, Rosie.
- Hey.

865
00:38:13,413 --> 00:38:15,947
So the M.R.A. confirmed the dissection.

866
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:18,015
The anti-coagulants
will resolve your symptoms

867
00:38:18,017 --> 00:38:19,149
and help you heal.

868
00:38:19,151 --> 00:38:20,417
So I'm okay.

869
00:38:20,419 --> 00:38:23,053
You're okay.

870
00:38:23,055 --> 00:38:26,023
But what about my voice,
and what about my career?

871
00:38:26,025 --> 00:38:27,325
Well, it sounds like your voice is already

872
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:28,526
returning to normal.

873
00:38:28,528 --> 00:38:30,628
As far as your career,

874
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,563
I have a theory about
what caused all this,

875
00:38:32,565 --> 00:38:35,300
and I'd like to test it, if that's okay?

876
00:38:39,405 --> 00:38:41,840
Well, that confirms it.

877
00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:43,741
Confirms what?
My skin's always been that way.

878
00:38:43,743 --> 00:38:45,643
Because of a genetic condition

879
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:47,712
that inhibits the production of collagen.

880
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:51,182
Collagen keeps the body's organs
from becoming too elastic.

881
00:38:51,184 --> 00:38:53,084
Organs, including the stomach.

882
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:54,719
- Mm-hmm.
- That's why I can eat so much.

883
00:38:54,721 --> 00:38:57,255
I don't have an iron stomach.
I have a rubber stomach.

884
00:38:57,257 --> 00:38:58,756
Precisely.

885
00:38:58,758 --> 00:39:00,458
But, the eating didn't make me sick.

886
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,026
Not at all, in fact,
the thing that made you sick

887
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:03,861
was the same thing
that made you a champion.

888
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:05,363
Luckily, with careful monitoring,

889
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:09,166
we'll keep you healthy
and competing at the same time.

890
00:39:09,168 --> 00:39:10,501
Hey.

891
00:39:10,503 --> 00:39:12,436
Are we blocking your parade route?

892
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:14,671
Oh...

893
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:16,740
You didn't say your forfeit was medical.

894
00:39:16,742 --> 00:39:19,977
No one likes excuses.

895
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:24,682
Lobster rolls.

896
00:39:24,684 --> 00:39:26,184
Well, I figured you'd want
to get a head start

897
00:39:26,186 --> 00:39:28,086
on your training for our rematch.

898
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:29,521
Please, these aren't even jumbos.

899
00:39:29,523 --> 00:39:32,457
I'd finish this box before
you even tucked in your bib.

900
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:33,592
I could eat circles around you

901
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:35,594
with my tongue tied behind my back.

902
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:37,863
Okay, I'll let you guys
trash-talk in private.

903
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,500
Here you go.

904
00:39:42,502 --> 00:39:43,801
What's this?

905
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,002
These are your starter kits.

906
00:39:45,004 --> 00:39:47,138
In them, amongst other things,
you will find

907
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,974
a monogrammed lab coat, a purchasing card,

908
00:39:49,976 --> 00:39:53,644
and a GPS device, so you know
where you are at all times,

909
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:55,313
and so do I.

910
00:39:55,315 --> 00:39:56,914
Okay.

911
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,917
Yes, Dr. Sacani?

912
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,218
Thank you.

913
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:05,991
I am very glad to be part
of this organization.

914
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:08,460
I am very glad to hear that.

915
00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:10,129
All right, that's it.

916
00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:15,568
Doctor?

917
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,969
Thank you.

918
00:40:19,372 --> 00:40:23,309
Gentlemen, welcome to Hankmed... 2.0.

919
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:38,090
Need a hand?

920
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:39,892
No.

921
00:40:39,894 --> 00:40:42,995
Last box.

922
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:44,330
All done.

923
00:40:44,332 --> 00:40:47,533
- End of an era.
- Beginning of an era.

924
00:40:47,535 --> 00:40:49,435
You ready to move onward and upward?

925
00:40:49,437 --> 00:40:52,705
Onward and upward.

926
00:40:52,707 --> 00:40:54,306
To the roof.

927
00:40:54,308 --> 00:40:55,875
For the fireworks finale?

928
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:56,909
You in?

929
00:40:56,911 --> 00:40:58,544
I was gonna take you for dinner.

930
00:40:58,546 --> 00:41:00,513
Guess I'm a cheap date.

931
00:41:00,515 --> 00:41:01,814
I didn't say I was buying.

932
00:41:01,816 --> 00:41:03,616
Where's Divya?

933
00:41:03,618 --> 00:41:05,017
I'm not sure.

934
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:06,919
She said she had to check up on someone.

935
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:08,787
Oh.

936
00:41:40,286 --> 00:41:43,721
Hello, mom.

937
00:41:43,723 --> 00:41:46,190
You shouldn't be here.

938
00:41:46,192 --> 00:41:47,324
Can I come in?

939
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:07,579
It's a pretty good view from up here.

940
00:42:07,581 --> 00:42:09,148
Yeah.

941
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,683
It is.

942
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,289
Oh, my God.

943
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,356
Hank, the park is full of people.

944
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:19,581
Evan!

945
