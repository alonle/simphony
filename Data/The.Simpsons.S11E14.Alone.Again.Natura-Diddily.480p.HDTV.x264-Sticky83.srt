1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,022
Previously on "Awkward"...

2
00:00:02,047 --> 00:00:04,217
If you don't have a plan to
get this debt taken care of,

3
00:00:04,242 --> 00:00:05,725
you're not going back to NYU.

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,882
So what are you guys celebrating?

5
00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:10,350
I am moving in with Luke
for the rest of the summer.

6
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,835
You said you wanted the world to know.

7
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:12,976
Not like this.

8
00:00:12,978 --> 00:00:14,546
Luke! A moment?

9
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:16,390
If you're happy with the work

10
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:18,232
that I'm doing, then that's one thing...

11
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:21,492
Publicly declaring my love for Luke

12
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:23,437
was supposed to be an epic gesture,

13
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:25,920
but had somehow turned
into an epic fail.

14
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:28,656
And now he was in Lizzy's
office running damage control.

15
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:30,558
He'd been in there for 26 minutes.

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,660
How much damage was
there to control anyway?

17
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,171
I had to wonder if there was more

18
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:36,063
to Luke's relationship with
Lizzy than he had told me.

19
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:37,185
You shouldn't have written that article

20
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:38,486
without consulting me, Jenna.

21
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:40,355
It was a violation of trust.

22
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:42,623
- And now Lizzy's really upset.
- Yeah.

23
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,703
A little too upset, if you ask me.

24
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:46,194
What is she, jealous?

25
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:48,196
She thinks I've been
lying and secretive.

26
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:50,198
Well, you have been lying and secretive.

27
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,766
You have no idea how hard it's gonna be

28
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:52,934
for me to smooth things over with her.

29
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:54,902
How do you plan to do that?

30
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:57,305
- Sleep with her?
- Grow up, Jenna.

31
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,179
I need some air.

32
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:01,409
Grow up?

33
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:03,311
- Grow up?
- You're acting like a child.

34
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,380
I am not, jerk! Lookit.

35
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:08,182
You're just pissed because
Lizzy has a thing for you,

36
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:10,251
and you wanted her to
think that she's got a shot

37
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:11,853
so that you can stay teacher's pet.

38
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:13,418
If that's what you think of me,

39
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:15,823
- what are you even doing with me?
- Honestly, I don't even know.

40
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,114
I'm leaving.

41
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,928
- So go!
- I am!

42
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,330
But I know you need the car later.

43
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,466
So I am leaving as soon
as the bus gets here.

44
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:30,292
Awkward. - 05x22 - Home Again, Home Again

45
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,707
Morning, beeyotch!

46
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,208
I brought you a $5 cup of coffee

47
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,111
in case you were homesick for New York.

48
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:38,236
You can't buy me back that easily.

49
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:39,894
After what you said to me?

50
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:41,930
Your cuppa joe is a cuppa joke.

51
00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:43,565
Are you seriously still mad about that?

52
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,900
We had a little fight.
Real friends get past those.

53
00:01:45,902 --> 00:01:48,436
Real friends don't say mean
things in the first place.

54
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:50,438
You called me an annoying dumbass.

55
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,206
And you called me an ass[bleep].

56
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,508
And I'm fine with it!

57
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,243
I get called an ass[bleep] all the time!

58
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:57,245
I'm going to have to do God-knows-what

59
00:01:57,247 --> 00:02:00,548
to get myself out of debt, and
you don't even seem to care!

60
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,849
What hurts the most

61
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:04,218
is that I actually thought we
were friends since New York.

62
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,054
Say what you want about Jenna,

63
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:08,089
but she would never treat me that way.

64
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:10,525
Okay, that was way
meaner than "ass[bleep]."

65
00:02:10,527 --> 00:02:12,393
So you're really not gonna forgive me?

66
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:14,596
Lissa always forgives me
when I treat her like crap.

67
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:16,998
- It's kind of my thing.
- I'm not Lissa.

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,399
And I don't understand

69
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:20,435
why you would want to
treat any friend like crap.

70
00:02:20,745 --> 00:02:23,972
I will accept your coffee,
but not your apology.

71
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:31,212
As recently as yesterday,

72
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:33,628
living with Luke made me feel so adult,

73
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:35,485
so then why today did fighting with Luke

74
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:37,054
make me just want my mom?

75
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,308
Mom?

76
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,457
Anyone home?

77
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:41,667
Okay.

78
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:44,561
If I couldn't have my mom,

79
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:46,830
at least I could have
my mom's clean sheets.

80
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:48,853
Living with Luke had
meant feeling grown up,

81
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,412
but it had also meant going
without the comforts of home.

82
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,878
Three flavors of ice cream.

83
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:59,687
A sink free of little shaving hairs.

84
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:01,188
Backup toilet paper.

85
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,491
Conditioner. Who
doesn't use conditioner?

86
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:05,760
It also meant I'd missed a lot of mail.

87
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:06,980
"Camp Pookah.

88
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:10,174
"After 57 years, Camp
Pookah is closing its doors.

89
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,199
"All alumni are invited

90
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:14,902
"to one last field
day on the campgrounds.

91
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:18,300
$20 registration fee must
be received no later than..."

92
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,917
Today?

93
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:21,509
Crap.

94
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,277
Since when are we doing hydrangeas?

95
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,845
They cost more than the lilies.

96
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:27,248
They cost a little more,
but they last twice as long.

97
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,850
And some members were
allergic to the lilies.

98
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:32,453
So I'm saving you money and
cutting down on complaints.

99
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:34,722
Oh, well, you should have asked me.

100
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:36,323
If you want to go back to the lilies...

101
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:37,261
No, it's fine. They're already here.

102
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:39,126
I thought we could use the extra money

103
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:40,861
towards new hand
dryers in the bathrooms.

104
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:42,630
I don't pay you to think, Rosati.

105
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:44,097
Meet me in the snack bar
when you're done here.

106
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:46,605
Rosa found a mouse skull
in the popcorn machine.

107
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:48,936
Pretty flowers, Jake!

108
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:49,956
Hey, is there any way

109
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:51,547
you could pick up Mrs.
Taylor at her house?

110
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:53,358
Her engine died and she
can't make it to my class.

111
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,635
I don't have time for that.
I got a million things to do.

112
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,760
Well, we all have our
crosses to bear, Jake.

113
00:03:57,762 --> 00:03:59,962
Managing this club is a demanding job.

114
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:01,531
Why does no one appreciate that?

115
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,292
No, literally, my new
class is called "Cross Fit."

116
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:07,904
We all bear crosses on our
back while doing core exercises.

117
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:09,438
I already bought all the crosses,

118
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,574
and if no one shows, I
won't meet my profit goal.

119
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:12,730
I can't leave,

120
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:15,288
but maybe I could record
you teaching the class

121
00:04:15,313 --> 00:04:17,513
on my phone and then email
the video to Mrs. Taylor.

122
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:18,915
Great!

123
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:21,217
Could you also send one
to Mrs. Yoo, Mr. Churchill?

124
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,286
Oh, and Selma Froder is in
Florida, she might want one...

125
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:26,022
Why don't I just upload it to YouTube,

126
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:27,490
and then whoever who
wants the link can have it?

127
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:28,891
That is so smart.

128
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,593
That way I can reach
so many more people.

129
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,019
Thank you, Jakey.

130
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,264
Good gosh, just think of
what Jesus could've done

131
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:37,567
if he'd had YouTube.

132
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:41,901
You are going to smile,

133
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,839
and you are going to take this

134
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:46,142
like the grown-ass woman that you are.

135
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,910
I know these heels are high.

136
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,579
I know this is degrading.

137
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,949
And you don't belong in
some strange hotel room.

138
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:56,152
But you need the money,
so you're gonna suck it up,

139
00:04:56,154 --> 00:04:58,081
and close your eyes if you need to.

140
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,837
Thank you so much for
filling in at the last minute.

141
00:05:09,862 --> 00:05:12,519
What maid of honor gets
taken down by strep throat?

142
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,244
More like maid of dishonor.

143
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:16,069
It's my pleasure.

144
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:18,605
I honestly didn't even know
professional bridesmaids

145
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:20,673
were a thing until my
wedding planner suggested it.

146
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:22,842
Jennifer was a disaster anyway.

147
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:26,379
She didn't even get a spray
tan for the rehearsal dinner.

148
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:28,448
If you ask me, she deserved strep.

149
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,917
Well, now I have someone
that I can order around,

150
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,286
and I don't have to feel bad
about it because I'm paying you.

151
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:34,854
Don't worry about a thing.

152
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,356
I'm a nuptials ninja,

153
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:38,625
and I will make sure everything
goes off without a hitch.

154
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:40,794
Speaking of which,
it's time for pictures.

155
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:43,696
Bring in the groomsmen!

156
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:45,398
Grease up those smiles, people.

157
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,767
You got a long day of
posing ahead of you.

158
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:51,538
Find your bridesmaid.
Find your groomsmen.

159
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,674
You're over there. Just
like we practiced, okay?

160
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:56,543
All right, guys, smile. Look alive.

161
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:58,678
You're the wedding party,
not the wedding funeral.

162
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,683
Tamara?

163
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,853
A camp reunion seemed
like the perfect way

164
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:09,022
to self-soothe after my fight with Luke.

165
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:11,891
I just hoped it wasn't too
late to act like a kid again.

166
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,593
I needed a return to myself,

167
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:16,396
a return to home and
happiness and security.

168
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:17,776
A return to...

169
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,933
Matty?

170
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:22,435
Jenna. Hey!

171
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,111
Well, I've been ignoring my mail.

172
00:06:29,113 --> 00:06:31,280
What's your excuse for signing up late?

173
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,849
I wasn't gonna go. I
mean, it's Camp Pookah.

174
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,651
Oh, come on, you loved this place.

175
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:38,954
I know, but it's in the past.
Why get all nostalgic about it?

176
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:41,947
But then I broke up with Sully
and figured, "What the hell?"

177
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:44,658
You broke up with Sully? Sorry.

178
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:46,932
- Don't act surprised.
- I liked her.

179
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,873
Once you realized she didn't hate you.

180
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,486
True.

181
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:52,454
Luke and I got in this
huge fight this morning,

182
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,112
and something about
running around Camp Pookah

183
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,615
cracked out on bug juice
just seemed comforting.

184
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,383
Lot of good times here.

185
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,651
The past isn't all bad, Matty.

186
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,253
You want to do something after this?

187
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,454
Misery loves company.

188
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,389
You know what misery loves more?

189
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,791
Frozen yogurt.

190
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,493
With gummy bears and those mochi things?

191
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,189
Mm-hmm.

192
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:10,907
We could get some and
bitch about our lives.

193
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:13,007
- Friends do that, right?
- They absolutely do.

194
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,465
Then let's absolutely do that.

195
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,838
I didn't know you were
friends with Kelly.

196
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,608
I'm not. She's paying me.

197
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,142
Wow. I mean, she is kind of a bitch,

198
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,678
but I figured she at least
had some real friends.

199
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,080
She's not paying me to be her friend.

200
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,315
She's paying me to be her
professional bridesmaid.

201
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,951
Okay, that's a wrap on
our first photo call.

202
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,354
There's veggie and dip
over on the buffet table.

203
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,688
No broccoli for you, Kelly.

204
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,088
The next few hours are too important.

205
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,061
Professional bridesmaid, huh?

206
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,197
So you're, like, embedded
with the wedding party?

207
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,366
I make sure everything
runs according to schedule.

208
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,391
You know how there's seat
fillers at the Oscars?

209
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,803
- No.
- I'm a dress filler for hire.

210
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,639
So you're like a hooker for weddings.

211
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,908
Totes. And it's all thanks to you.

212
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,076
If I was never a fake fiancée,
I would have never amassed

213
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,149
the vast knowledge base required.

214
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:03,447
It's so crazy that we
ran into each other.

215
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,051
And like this. It feels like fate.

216
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,686
It does.

217
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,923
In fact, I've been meaning to call you.

218
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:12,994
You have?

219
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,693
You're coming to the reception, right?

220
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,062
I have to. Hooker and all that.

221
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,397
But now that I know
you're going to be there,

222
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,631
I'm looking forward to it.

223
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,111
Me too.

224
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,303
Because I want to introduce you to Amy.

225
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,504
Oh, who's Amy?

226
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:28,139
My fiancée.

227
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,473
Your what?

228
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,016
Ab-solve yourself of sin one!

229
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,986
Ab-solve yourself of sin two!

230
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,322
Again!

231
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,324
What fresh hell is this?

232
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,439
Cut!

233
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,860
Sadie, can't you see we're
in the middle of a take?

234
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,629
Liss, can you do your Godilates later?

235
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,266
You'll never believe how rude
Tamara was to me this morning.

236
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,201
Actually, I'm in the
middle of something.

237
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,302
Can I call you later?

238
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,837
No one's gonna care if you stop now.

239
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,405
Look, that one's not even breathing.

240
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,479
Mr. Turner?

241
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,776
Mr. Turner. He was
just on a rest interval.

242
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,312
Come on, come get a smoothie with me.

243
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,047
Atonercise is a joke.

244
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,182
Okay, this joke

245
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,150
is actually very popular
with my older clients.

246
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,819
I wouldn't expect you to know this,

247
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,687
not being a businesswoman yourself,

248
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,590
but retirees are an extremely
profitable demographic.

249
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,792
You actually think you're
gonna make money off this?

250
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,494
You know what, Sadie?

251
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,630
You can't ignore me all summer
and then just waltz in here

252
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,598
one day and expect me to get a smoothie.

253
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,066
Whoa. What's your damage?

254
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,268
I have recently been
awakened as a feminist.

255
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,638
And I have come to realize
that your friendship

256
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,139
is extremely oppressive.

257
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,509
Lissa, don't take this the wrong way,

258
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,411
but you're a [bleep] moron.

259
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,413
Stop being the patriarchy to me!

260
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,148
You're always pushing me down!

261
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,818
If you're not prepared to
be respectful, you can leave.

262
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,525
I will then!

263
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,091
Okay.

264
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,560
So what was your fight with Luke about?

265
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,821
I wrote this thing
about him on Idea Bin.

266
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:01,232
Jeez, Jenna, maybe you should
step away from the computer.

267
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,633
I know, I just thought I was making

268
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,068
this big romantic gesture.

269
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,903
Ugh, he keeps calling me.

270
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,539
I've been yelled at enough for one day.

271
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,007
So what happened with Sully?

272
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,677
She's an awesome girl,
just not awesome for me.

273
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,313
She just wouldn't go deep on
an emotional level, you know?

274
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,015
She's kind of closed off.

275
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,484
And that's a bad thing, correct?

276
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,421
Yes, I want to be with someone
who wants to really know me.

277
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,190
Oh, come on, you aren't
exactly an open book yourself.

278
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,092
Getting you to "go deep
on an emotional level"

279
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,928
is sort of like like snorkeling
when you really want to scuba.

280
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,400
Really? I'm that closed off?

281
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,999
Was I closed off with you?

282
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,834
It's gonna take something
a little stronger

283
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,770
than chocolate coconut
swirl for me to answer that.

284
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,272
Luckily, awesome Sully left a bottle

285
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,240
of peppermint schnapps in my truck.

286
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,742
Shall we get drunk and get real?

287
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,277
We shall.

288
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:51,915
Ugh, tastes like lighter
fluid and breath mints.

289
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,207
Yeah, I don't think you're
supposed to drink it straight.

290
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,609
I wouldn't want to drink it gay either.

291
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:58,177
Wow, that was bad.

292
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,812
So bad. Horrendous.

293
00:10:59,814 --> 00:11:01,714
See? I'm not closed off.

294
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:04,417
I was very open to the fact
that that was an awful joke.

295
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,319
I didn't say you're closed
off about everything.

296
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:08,254
Just everything emotional.

297
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,990
It's just standard dude stuff, I guess.

298
00:11:10,992 --> 00:11:13,559
I'm sorry, I don't want you to
think I'm being super critical.

299
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,862
No, I don't. It's actually nice.

300
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:18,131
With Sully, the deepest
stuff we ever talked about

301
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:19,465
was during Truth or Dare.

302
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,467
And 90% of the time,
she chose dare anyway.

303
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,136
Okay, tell you what.

304
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:24,570
This is the hood of trust.

305
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:26,606
Everything we say here is safe.

306
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:29,208
You can ask me anything, and
I have to answer truthfully.

307
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,777
Truth or truth?

308
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:31,911
Truth or truth.

309
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:35,549
Okay, same goes for you.

310
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:37,454
And nothing leaves the hood.

311
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,612
Okay.

312
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,041
But can we really ask
each other anything?

313
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,908
Anything.

314
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:46,019
Okay, this is my first question,

315
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:49,189
and I really don't want it
to damage our relationship,

316
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:50,857
but I just have to know.

317
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:53,059
Why do you have a dream
catcher in your room?

318
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:54,894
I made that in Webelos, jerk.

319
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,830
Hood of trust.

320
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,632
Okay, we're going there.

321
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,001
What was up with the
side braid sophomore year?

322
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,104
You never took it out.

323
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:05,205
One minor misstep in an
otherwise flawless hair record.

324
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:06,673
Never to be revisited.

325
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:09,175
Speaking of things
never to be revisited:

326
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:11,778
- Eva?
- Oh, so hot.

327
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,747
- Colin?
- So hot.

328
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:15,815
What? I was high that whole semester.

329
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:16,635
What do you want from me?

330
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,419
Yeah, your taste in guys
has not always been stellar.

331
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:21,755
Well, excluding me, of course.

332
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:23,256
And Jake.

333
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:26,226
You dated Jake? Oh, right, yeah.

334
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:27,961
Ooh! I love it!

335
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:31,097
"Atonercise with Lissa
Miller." How'd you do that?

336
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:32,365
On my computer.

337
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,234
It's just an editing
program. It was easy.

338
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,903
This looks amazing. You are so smart.

339
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:38,171
For a townie.

340
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:40,173
No, you're smart for a person.

341
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:42,108
I mean that's, like, professional.

342
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,777
Thanks. I have a lot of ideas

343
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:46,046
for the club and Derek is
always shooting 'em down.

344
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:48,648
Well, Derek needs to get a life.

345
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,183
Yeah, well, maybe I do.

346
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:51,393
What do you mean?

347
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:54,916
I think maybe I need to start
thinking about my future.

348
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,994
I don't know if it's here.

349
00:12:57,926 --> 00:12:59,426
Thank you for helping me

350
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:01,494
with my final professional
bridesmaid's task,

351
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:03,263
assuming that Kelly
cools it on the champagne.

352
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:04,631
If she pukes, she'll need hair-holding,

353
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,800
and that falls under my job description.

354
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,596
Just doing my duty as best man.

355
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:10,837
I also wanted to say

356
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:13,340
I'm so glad we ran
into each other today.

357
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:14,774
Yeah.

358
00:13:14,776 --> 00:13:17,410
Amy's really sweet and
really freaking pretty.

359
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,179
I'm so glad I got to meet her.

360
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:21,713
Thanks, but that's not why.

361
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,250
I'm glad we ran into each other

362
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:28,688
because I always hoped
we'd end up friends.

363
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,891
You were way too important
to me to just fade away.

364
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:34,327
Yeah. Me too.

365
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:37,197
Tamara, you knew I
wanted to get married.

366
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,265
It's something I've wanted a long time.

367
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,568
But you weren't ready, and I get that.

368
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,969
I guess.

369
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,071
Okay, would you really want
to give up NYU right now

370
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:46,973
to move to a base in North Carolina?

371
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:48,854
I guess not.

372
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:53,480
So, friend, what's going
on in your love life?

373
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:55,382
- Actually, I'm dating someone.
- Yeah?

374
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,417
He's tall and sweet and rich,

375
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,886
and most importantly, all about me.

376
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:02,389
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah, I'm doing good.

377
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,190
The only hitch in the giddyup

378
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:07,727
is that I've been heavily lying to him

379
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:11,564
about being rich myself when
I'm actually $12,000 in debt,

380
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:13,767
but, you know, in the
grand scheme of things,

381
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,968
it's no biggie.

382
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,803
Okay, it's a small biggie.

383
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:17,937
It's a biggie small.

384
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:19,406
Why do you always do that?

385
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:20,740
I'm a wordsmith at heart.

386
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:22,175
Equipped to quip. I can't help myself.

387
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:23,843
No, I mean lie to guys about yourself.

388
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:25,111
Do you not think you're enough somehow?

389
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:26,413
What?

390
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:27,847
You lied to me about
wanting to get married.

391
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,716
You told me how you
catfished your ex that time.

392
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:31,618
- Autumn San Francisco...
- San Diego.

393
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,189
The point is you need to
come clean to this guy.

394
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:38,892
And if he doesn't like the real you,

395
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:41,761
maybe he isn't worth it.

396
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:49,235
What's up, sexual chocolate?

397
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:51,494
I thought you stopped serving at 9:00.

398
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:55,275
Did you start handing out
coupons at Urban Outfitters?

399
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:58,845
Sadita, meet my friends,
Rick and Richard.

400
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:00,146
- 'Sup?
- Aloha.

401
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:01,354
No.

402
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:04,984
Ditch these douches. I
want to hang out with you.

403
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:06,319
Everyone else sucks.

404
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:07,487
I can't right now, okay?

405
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,666
You can't talk to me

406
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,990
because you need to eat
tamales with these Ricks?

407
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:13,460
They're huge fans of my food
and we've rescheduled a lot.

408
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:15,895
Sorry, babe, can I meet you later?

409
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:17,297
They're just tamales.

410
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,632
It's street food! Eat a hot dog!

411
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:21,634
If you're so desperate
to eat this [bleep],

412
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:23,127
go to his Mami's house.

413
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:25,305
She's the one who does
most of the cooking anyway.

414
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:27,073
You know what, man,
we can just come back.

415
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:29,209
Yeah, September's wide
open as of right now.

416
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:31,845
No, no, no, no, don't
go. She's just in a mood.

417
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,047
- As usual.
- It's all good, brother.

418
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,338
We'll catch you on the flip.

419
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:41,754
Don't look at me like that, "brother."

420
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:43,590
They'll catch you on the flip.

421
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:44,958
What the [bleep] was that?

422
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,726
Those guys were investors!

423
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,495
They own a whole fleet
of grilled cheese trucks,

424
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:51,164
and they wanted to talk to me
about expanding my business.

425
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:54,000
- Are you crazy?
- [bleep]! I didn't know.

426
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:57,170
No, I'm the crazy one for
getting back together with you.

427
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,105
Fool me once, shame on you.

428
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:01,479
Fool me twice, I'm out.

429
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:03,965
I didn't...

430
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:09,716
I think if we'd have met in
college, we'd be engaged now.

431
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,253
Who knows? We've tried so many times.

432
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:15,421
But you're probably right.

433
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:16,789
Maybe if we met when we were older.

434
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,125
After you'd sowed your wild oats?

435
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:20,360
Mine?

436
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,128
Some of your oats have
been pretty wild too.

437
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,930
Fair.

438
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:27,734
You know, in some ways,
we grew up together.

439
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,503
Well, sometimes
together, sometimes apart.

440
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:34,307
Either way, you're one of the
closest friends I've ever had.

441
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,675
Probably ever will have.

442
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:37,143
Thanks, Jenna.

443
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:39,299
You're welcome, Matthew.

444
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:41,111
You know...

445
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:43,383
Never mind.

446
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:44,330
No, what?

447
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:45,996
I don't know what it is about you,

448
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:48,421
but whenever something
important happens in my life,

449
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:50,623
whether it's good or bad,

450
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,604
you're the first person I
want to talk to about it.

451
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,597
Yeah, we've known each other for so long

452
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,596
and been through so much,

453
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:03,903
you're like a blankie that
smells like my mom's oak chest

454
00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:06,372
and still has bite marks
from when I was teething.

455
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:08,474
Gee, thanks. I'm a ratty old blanket?

456
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:10,810
You know what I mean. You're like...

457
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:14,291
I don't know, home to me.

458
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:17,483
Well, one thing's for certain.

459
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:19,218
Our timing's always been off.

460
00:17:22,823 --> 00:17:24,390
Always.

461
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,466
Patrick.

462
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,274
Hi, it's me.

463
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:38,539
There's something that
I need to tell you.

464
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,344
How did he know where to find me?

465
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:45,079
He texted me looking for you.

466
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:47,173
Wait, I'm sorry. You guys text?

467
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,984
You weren't answering my calls.

468
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,719
He said he really needed to apologize.

469
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:53,721
And I thought you'd want to hear it.

470
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:55,189
I'm sorry I involved you, man.

471
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:56,690
It's just, whenever something happens,

472
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:58,493
you're the one she wants to talk to.

473
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,823
Can I talk to you?

474
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:10,871
Jenna, look, I'm sorry.

475
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:13,493
I don't know what got
into me this morning.

476
00:18:15,645 --> 00:18:17,611
Actually, no. I do know.

477
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:20,281
You were right about me and Lizzy.

478
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:22,183
- What?
- Nothing happened.

479
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,617
Nothing ever would happen.

480
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:24,952
I have to admit that I wanted Lizzy

481
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:27,087
to think that it was
still a possibility.

482
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:30,224
All the author events and
the readings she takes me to,

483
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:31,618
they're a huge opportunity.

484
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,563
And I'm not in a position
to turn that stuff down.

485
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,779
I'm sorry I couldn't
just admit it earlier,

486
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,914
but I hadn't really
admitted it to myself.

487
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,184
That's why I was such a jerk
when you called me on it.

488
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,516
Okay.

489
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,930
I was wrong.

490
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,735
And I was weak.

491
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,428
And I'm really embarrassed.

492
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,751
And sorry.

493
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,098
Can you forgive me?

494
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,068
As far as apologies go,
that was a pretty good one.

495
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,536
I can do better.

496
00:18:58,538 --> 00:18:59,671
Do you remember how you always wanted

497
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:01,172
to get into SCU more than anything?

498
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,540
Dean Strauss just emailed me.

499
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,696
He loves your stuff,

500
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:05,209
and he wants you to
come in for an interview.

501
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,477
Are you serious?

502
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,945
He thinks you have a unique voice.

503
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,214
I sent him a couple of your
best pieces a few weeks ago.

504
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:11,683
I hope that's okay.

505
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:12,784
I wanted it to be a surprise.

506
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:15,046
I'm definitely surprised.

507
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,654
With your grades from Wyckoff

508
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,989
and your track record at Idea Bin,

509
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,857
you have a real shot at transferring.

510
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,927
This is amazing. I can't
believe you did that.

511
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,274
Huh!

512
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,664
He really said I have a unique voice?

513
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,633
- He really said that?
- I have the email to prove it.

514
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:29,938
Let's go home.

515
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,970
I stocked the freezer with Rocky Road.

516
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,984
You are a really good apologizer.

517
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,626
One sec.

518
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,196
Thank you for telling
him where to find me.

519
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,929
And thank you for tonight.

520
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,964
Hey, that's what friends are for.
