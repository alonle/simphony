1
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:20,824
Jeff, you haven't even looked
at the new course catalog.

2
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:22,098
I'm like a kid in a candy store.

3
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:24,683
Well, the candy has lost its
appeal now that I work at the store.

4
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:27,613
You might say becoming a
teacher here gave me diabetes.

5
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:29,093
I was just saying that.

6
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:32,153
Are you always thirsty and fatigued
and you have blurry vision and

7
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:33,153
your cuts heal slower?

8
00:00:33,153 --> 00:00:35,363
Those are actual diabetes symptoms.

9
00:00:35,363 --> 00:00:37,143
That's what the doctor said.

10
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:38,753
So, is he treating it?

11
00:00:38,753 --> 00:00:40,143
I asked him the same thing.

12
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:41,023
What did he say?

13
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:44,313
He said, make an appointment through
his office during business hours.

14
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:46,086
This is his home, his children sleep here.

15
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:47,211
You know doctors.

16
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:49,169
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

17
00:00:49,169 --> 00:00:52,211
There's a class called Basic Grifting.

18
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:55,413
Should we all learn how
to be grifters together?

19
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:56,883
Wait, what do grifters do again?

20
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:58,063
I got this.

21
00:00:58,063 --> 00:00:59,253
I'll tell you for five bucks.

22
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:00,423
No.

23
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:01,573
You better sign me up Me too.

24
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:04,103
I've always wanted to learn more
about grifting ever since I saw 1990's,

25
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:06,513
The Grifters, featuring John
Cusack, Anjelica Huston, and

26
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:07,373
almost no grifting.

27
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:09,273
You guys, don't take a grifting class.

28
00:01:09,273 --> 00:01:10,533
You're going to get grifted.

29
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:13,793
Even more so than by that oceanography
class, only none of you will

30
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:16,003
even get a goldfish, then you're
gonna come crying back to me.

31
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:17,003
Why you?

32
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:18,353
Because, lets face it,

33
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:21,363
I'm the closest thing that Greendale
has to an experienced grifter.

34
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:26,203
Oh, this is one of those things where
Jeff gets jealous of something dumb.

35
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:27,934
Jeff's jealous of a grifter.

36
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:29,961
Because he wishes he was still a grifter

37
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:34,461
That's something even I could
mock, and I live in an RV.

38
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,169
I'm judging you, and my dinner
table folds down from a wall.

39
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:40,537
I say we all take the grifting class
together, have a great time, and

40
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:42,183
rub it in Jeff's face!

41
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:43,523
Who's in, and can you cover me?

42
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:44,323
I'll pay you back.

43
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:45,683
I'll get it from your parents.

44
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:46,933
I'll pay you back.

45
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:48,973
At which point I'll pay back your parents.

46
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:49,993
Which will be never.

47
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:53,567
I'll get a high five from your parents.

48
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,978
All right, each student
should bring a briefcase.

49
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:57,378
I don't have a briefcase.

50
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:58,778
We're gonna grift with briefcases?

51
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:00,593
Basic my ass, that's advanced.

52
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:01,148
Mm-hm.

53
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:02,558
I have a few extra briefcases.

54
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:03,848
Shocker. Are they regulation?

55
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:05,788
We each need a regulation
grifting briefcase.

56
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:06,628
It's a grift.

57
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:08,728
What's a regulation briefcase?

58
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:09,588
I don't know.

59
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,558
But they're provided for only $150.

60
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:13,098
You're being grifted.

61
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:13,908
Shut up, Jeff.

62
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:15,558
You're such a negative person.

63
00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:17,938
What do you contribute to
this group besides negativity?

64
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:21,503
Guys, watch this, can I borrow $150?

65
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:22,473
No. See!

66
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:26,063
Now who's gonna come with me
and show this guy what's up?

67
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,753
I'll pay you back. I'll
get it from your parents.

68
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:30,378
Tell them I spit on their
wealth and thank you.

69
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,088
Good morning.

70
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:18,670
My name is Professor Roger
DeSalvo, for the time being.

71
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,022
For I use many a pseudonym, such
as Jeff Goulash, Philip Switch,

72
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:24,704
or Baz Ravish.

73
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,447
For I am a grifter and
this is Grifting 101.

74
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:38,424
Now which one of you thinks
I did that on purpose?

75
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:42,184
Exactly, you think you've seen me fail.

76
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:45,524
You think you've spotted a weakness.

77
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:49,594
Let me tell you something, with a flick
of a wrist, I could show you a fool

78
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:53,654
one minute, or longer.

79
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:55,024
I see you've got your briefcases.

80
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:56,920
Excellent. Hold them aloft.

81
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,295
Pass them to each other.

82
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,546
Now pass them back.

83
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:09,046
Do it at speed.

84
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:10,304
Quicker!

85
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:11,124
Pass them like hell.

86
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:18,254
Pass them like your sister's dying,
and continue that for about 40 minutes.

87
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:23,119
Wait, 40 minutes?

88
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:24,001
What's your name, my love?

89
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,324
Annie Edison.

90
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:26,554
That sounds like a real name,

91
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:29,669
not the name of a grifter
and therefore, not a teacher.

92
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,794
Ahem.

93
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:32,294
What?

94
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:33,864
My name is Slick Pockets Tucker.

95
00:04:33,864 --> 00:04:34,444
No, it's not.

96
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:36,604
That's correct. I was just wondering
what the next lesson will be.

97
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:40,094
The next lesson will be
passing two briefcases.

98
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:42,504
You need to master the
art of passing one, and

99
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:45,204
then you can purchase another briefcase.

100
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,629
What? You talk too much.

101
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:49,754
Keep passing.

102
00:04:50,955 --> 00:04:56,004
It's a very funny book.

103
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:05,629
Oh no, grifters.

104
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:09,670
I better watch my french
fries unless, counterfeit?

105
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,879
Where'd you learn to do that?

106
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,962
We didn't learn anything.

107
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:13,712
That class is... A rip off?

108
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:15,462
Hm, what's another word for that?

109
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,754
All he did was throw his hat
and make us pass briefcases.

110
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:19,212
And, he kept trying to sell us stuff.

111
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:22,119
Briefcase swapping talcum for
grifters palm, briefcase hinge oil for

112
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:25,129
silence switcheroos, and something
called extra believable socks.

113
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:28,171
Those are actually half off, I
kind of feel like I grifted him.

114
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:33,462
So in a sense, what happened is
you took a class about grifting.

115
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:40,545
Aaaaaannnnnd... Jeff, you
really need us to say it?

116
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:44,045
You were... Eh, whoa, whoa,
yeah I need you to say it.

117
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:46,880
Let me just get settled.

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,462
Okay go.

119
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:51,087
You were right.

120
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:55,296
Yeah.

121
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:57,129
Well, you live and you learn, guys.

122
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,629
Well, you live anyway.

123
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,454
So now, will you please help us?

124
00:06:00,454 --> 00:06:01,554
Help you?

125
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:02,794
We want revenge.

126
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:03,584
We wanna grift him back.

127
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:04,654
You wanna grift a grifter?

128
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:06,084
That's as dumb as taking his class.

129
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:06,837
Just cut your losses.

130
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:07,587
But, Jeff.

131
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:10,587
I begged you not to go down this
path, and you made fun of me.

132
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,004
You pointed in my face and laughed.

133
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,712
We're sorry we hurt your feelings.

134
00:06:13,712 --> 00:06:15,504
My feelings are fine.

135
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:18,504
I'm just very lazy, and you
gave me an excuse to do nothing.

136
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,712
I'm not just gonna throw that away.

137
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,962
You don't want to take this guy down?

138
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,670
He's even lazier than you.

139
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,087
Doesn't your species
consider that a challenge?

140
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:28,924
Shouldn't you be on some kind of reverse
pissing contest to determine who's

141
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:29,462
laziest?

142
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:31,420
Wait, is that where you
suck it back up in your?

143
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,295
I'm sorry, I've only ever
done it the other way.

144
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,629
You mean peeing?

145
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,045
No, I mean in the back.

146
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:42,712
He hasn't done anything to me.

147
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:44,670
In fact, he sounds like a pretty good guy.

148
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,087
I bet we'd get along.

149
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,629
Good show.

150
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:52,945
Good show.

151
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:53,750
What show?

152
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,879
I haven't seen that show.

153
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,629
All right.

154
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:58,795
All the best.

155
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:00,045
And, you are?

156
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,567
Well, I was the guy with a full bottle
of scotch and a high tolerance for

157
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,207
foreigners.

158
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:07,237
How robust.

159
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:09,087
I'd imagine that you're Jeff Winger.

160
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:11,920
Turns out we're going to be office buddies.

161
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,837
Hello there, sir.

162
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:15,129
My name is Roger DeSalvo.

163
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,046
Or is it?

164
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:18,462
You see, I happen to be
in the... Grifting 101.

165
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:19,754
Yes, I've heard about you.

166
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,920
That would be your desk.

167
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,380
If you need a mnemonic device,

168
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,088
it's the one without someone
else's stuff all over it.

169
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:28,837
Well played, very well played.

170
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:30,837
I gotta say.

171
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:33,879
I admire your style.

172
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,337
Grifting people by selling
them grifting lessons?

173
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:38,494
It's genius, but I called it.

174
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:40,284
I never said my class was a grift.

175
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:42,144
I don't worry about me, I'm one of you.

176
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,504
Was, anyway.

177
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,045
Do tell.

178
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:48,960
Well, I worked at one of the top law
firms in the city as a lawyer, but

179
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,920
guess what.

180
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,523
I'm not a lawyer.

181
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:54,212
Well, I think you're talking about lying.

182
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,129
Grifting happens to be an art form.

183
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:57,630
The art of lying.

184
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,295
Let's not get high-handed.

185
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:00,884
Grifting is lying.

186
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:02,754
Okay. So, like a string is a sweater?

187
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:04,724
Like, paint is the Sistine Chapel?

188
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:08,914
Sure, grifting includes lying, but
only a liar would call grifting lying.

189
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:11,995
And, only a delusional
hobo would glorify stealing.

190
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:13,879
Really? Did you say something
that wasn't true there?

191
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,564
Maybe we should phone the museum.

192
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:17,014
I was on your side.

193
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:17,744
You're an ass.

194
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:19,784
Well, you're a craftless, artless thug.

195
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:21,924
And, I'm God's paintbrush.

196
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:25,754
No, I am God, which pretty
much makes me better than you.

197
00:08:29,046 --> 00:08:31,212
You know what?

198
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:33,110
Let's agree to disagree.

199
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,626
It's not important.

200
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:36,253
Oh, okay.

201
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:37,347
So, you can lie.

202
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:38,786
Yeah, you liar.

203
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:41,851
Yeah.

204
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:46,212
I wanna speak to you, you son of a bitch.

205
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:48,045
What?

206
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:50,045
I love you.

207
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:52,670
Oh.

208
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,170
I do too.

209
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,296
Good.

210
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:58,545
Hm.

211
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:00,754
Hm.

212
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:03,212
Why are you guys still doing that?

213
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:07,920
Well, it was homework, and
we're getting better, right?

214
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,838
Or, the friction has gradually melted
the handle to fit into our palms.

215
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:12,087
There's nothing to get better at.

216
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:13,254
The class is a grift.

217
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:15,879
The next person who says
grift is gonna grift!

218
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,004
My god, now it's replacing other words.

219
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,034
All right, I'm in.

220
00:09:20,784 --> 00:09:22,129
Let's grift the son of a bitch.

221
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:26,545
Yay!

222
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:27,420
Why are you cheering?

223
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,337
He could be saying anything.

224
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:31,906
Grift!

225
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,475
Grift!

226
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:35,118
Grift!

227
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:35,761
Grift!

228
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:36,404
Grift!

229
00:09:36,404 --> 00:09:37,026
Grift!

230
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,840
Good work, I can't remember your name.

231
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,732
Likewise, no idea what your name is.

232
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,772
Great job.

233
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:01,952
All right.

234
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:06,782
I say you're pretty close to
swapping the briefcases loaded with

235
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:09,272
actual fake money such as this.

236
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:11,422
This isn't real money,
it's just cut up newspaper.

237
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:14,232
But it weighs the same,
costs five dollars a piece.

238
00:10:14,232 --> 00:10:15,362
You'll be using ten.

239
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,782
Telegram for Elroy Patashnik.

240
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:19,312
I'm Patashnik.

241
00:10:20,372 --> 00:10:21,112
Telegram, sir.

242
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:24,632
Oh, my God.

243
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:26,696
My Aunt Baba died on
vacation while in Africa.

244
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:27,787
Aw.

245
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,742
But she left me a million dollars, but

246
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:32,322
the African government
wants to seize the funds.

247
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:33,610
Class dismissed.

248
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:37,450
Not you.

249
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:43,986
Are you out of your mind?

250
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:46,492
What? The African telegram.

251
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:48,042
The Jim Belushi of grift?

252
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,652
Are you trying to grift me?

253
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:50,759
I'll cut you in for fourteen grand.

254
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,406
Get out.

255
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:57,795
Out.

256
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:00,233
One more thing.

257
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,342
Nice try twice.

258
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:06,582
Twice? The fake grift within the
grift, or the double bean, if you like.

259
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,902
I'm gonna mention a name and however
you react, I'll know the truth.

260
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:15,319
Jeff Winger, that's the one!

261
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:17,212
Jeff Winger? What with the, who?

262
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:18,502
That's the one.

263
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:19,862
Out you go.

264
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:20,452
Say hi to him.

265
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:28,985
By the way, Jeff Winger, nice try thrice.

266
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,862
Hey, how was grifting class?

267
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:37,782
Did you teach some advanced grifting
techniques only you could understand?

268
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,242
The Brown Betty?

269
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:40,302
The Texas oil baby?

270
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:41,592
The reverse Jim Gaffigan?

271
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:44,532
Well, I wouldn't teach
the African telegram.

272
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:46,182
Since I'm not a hack.

273
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:48,452
And also, since the Internet.

274
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:49,582
Okay.

275
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:50,272
You got me.

276
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:50,932
Game over.

277
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:56,076
- Let's end this competition
- Cheers to that.

278
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:03,537
Sir, you.

279
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:05,202
That guy left his lottery
ticket on the table.

280
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:06,402
That was the telegram man.

281
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:06,922
No, it wasn't.

282
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:08,612
I mean what telegram?

283
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:09,332
Exactly.

284
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:10,632
What telegram?

285
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:12,962
Because the Internet, you know?

286
00:12:12,962 --> 00:12:15,982
That place that you obviously went
to to type in the word grifting.

287
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:18,372
I'm gonna grift you.

288
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:20,042
I'm gonna grift your ass.

289
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,781
Or is that the grift?

290
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,012
None of it is a grift!

291
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,522
It's all nonsense!

292
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:29,252
Okay, how many times have I told
you people the faculty lounge is

293
00:12:29,252 --> 00:12:30,372
not a bar?

294
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:32,482
All right, pack it up people.

295
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:35,485
Come on, you don't have to go teach
a class but you can't stay here.

296
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:37,193
Look, truce.

297
00:12:37,193 --> 00:12:38,522
Okay?

298
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:42,140
Promise no more grifting and
promise, if this is worth a million,

299
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,752
we'll split it.

300
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:45,292
You're an idiot.

301
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:47,742
Or maybe I'm a genius.

302
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:48,552
No, I can answer that.

303
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:49,932
You're definitely an idiot.

304
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:52,272
Can an idiot walk backwards
like this and not hit anything?

305
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,152
Maybe. Or, maybe not.

306
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,568
What?

307
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,943
What are you doing here?

308
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:10,735
This guy is a grifter.

309
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:12,360
Professor of grifting.

310
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,150
He charges $400, you
get two brief cases and

311
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,542
your ex boyfriend becomes an obsessive.

312
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:20,351
I didn't know you and Winger were lovers.

313
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:23,702
If he wanted my respect, he
should have opened with that.

314
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,732
Are you trying to be disarming?

315
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:28,062
Are you grifting me out of my arms?

316
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:28,952
I did nothing to that man.

317
00:13:28,952 --> 00:13:30,272
He called himself a grifter.

318
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:31,472
I just simply corrected him.

319
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:34,322
Yeah, because the truth is so
important to the both of you.

320
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:38,735
So what's it gonna cost
to make you go away?

321
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,777
Well?

322
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:48,992
He took the bait.

323
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:49,582
Yes.

324
00:13:49,582 --> 00:13:50,172
Yes.

325
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:52,052
Wait, I thought we didn't
want him to take the bait?

326
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:53,283
No, no, we're saying the same thing.

327
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:55,122
He didn't take the bait,
we didn't want taken.

328
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:58,262
The African Telegram?

329
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:03,412
Yeah, which was offered as fake bait
and taken as such, ie, not taken.

330
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:05,372
Because that made him feel in control.

331
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:08,952
And by avoiding all visible bait, he
placed himself on the invisible hook

332
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:10,782
of assuming we're planning to grift him.

333
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:11,582
Oh, I like it.

334
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:12,242
Yeah.

335
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:12,742
And.

336
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:13,762
But we are.

337
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:15,292
So we knows the truth.

338
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,942
Isn't that like the one thing you're
not supposed to know when you're

339
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:18,442
being grifted?

340
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:18,942
Hm.

341
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:24,112
He can know a plan all he wants.

342
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:26,492
But the plan he knows won't be our plan.

343
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:27,172
Okay.

344
00:14:27,172 --> 00:14:28,632
Oh.

345
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:33,943
Because our plan is impossible to know?

346
00:14:33,943 --> 00:14:41,102
Because, oh, my god, Jeff
is making this up as we go.

347
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:43,542
Shh, knock it off.

348
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:44,612
What do you want from me?

349
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:46,832
We wanted you to help us do a grift.

350
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:47,380
I'm working on it.

351
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,589
Improvisationally?

352
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:49,963
He definitely had in the plan in The Sting.

353
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:52,382
If anybody wants to watch it it's
important you know it knocks out half

354
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:52,963
a calendar day.

355
00:14:52,963 --> 00:14:56,063
Look, do you guys remember
when we hugged and jumped up and

356
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,338
down in the cafeteria?

357
00:14:57,338 --> 00:14:57,957
Yeah.

358
00:14:57,957 --> 00:14:58,692
Obviously.

359
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:02,002
Well, having been together
virtually non-stop ever since,

360
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,152
at what point do you think
I slipped off with pen and

361
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:08,082
paper and planned an entire
grift, then withheld it from you?

362
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:13,692
I guess at any of the several dozen
points when a normal person would say,

363
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,682
by the way, I have no plan.

364
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,422
In The Sting, they do
withhold stuff from each other.

365
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:19,052
Or from the audience,
but I think for effect.

366
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,822
Also, be warned, 20% of
the movie is hand drawn.

367
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:23,482
Abed, why don't you marry The Sting?

368
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:25,505
Okay, just so you know, if I do
and we have half Sting children,

369
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:27,827
when they ask me how to grift, I'm
gonna tell them to watch their mother,

370
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:28,440
not listen to you!

371
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,940
Yeah!

372
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,457
Shut up, okay!

373
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:36,842
You guys, you're, you're
always picking on me, all right?

374
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:37,843
Oh. Oh.

375
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:39,247
And you've really been hammering me lately.

376
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:42,959
All I had was the idea that,

377
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,167
look, look, I, I need this.

378
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:49,997
I need to be better than this guy.

379
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:51,657
So let me think.

380
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:56,895
Abed.

381
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:57,577
Yeah?

382
00:15:57,577 --> 00:15:58,391
Did you bring your laptop?

383
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:01,062
Yes, right here.

384
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:01,641
What do you wanna do with it?

385
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,101
Watch The Sting.

386
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:12,552
It's over.

387
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:13,887
Whatever.

388
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:15,093
Who got shot?

389
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:16,209
What's going on?

390
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,642
Was Sting even in it?

391
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,272
That movie was terrible.

392
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:20,162
You slept the whole time.

393
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:20,852
Yeah, that's worse.

394
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:22,232
The dialogue seeped into my dreams.

395
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,432
My whole brain is long and quiet.

396
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,752
So how did they grift him?

397
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:29,262
Well, they basically
made a fake building and

398
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:32,822
hired 1,000 people to
cooperate in perfect secrecy.

399
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:33,612
Huh.

400
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:35,012
Should we just do that?

401
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:36,542
We could watch another grifter movie.

402
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:37,832
There's more activity in Matchstick Men.

403
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:38,492
Oh, like what?

404
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,622
At one point they build a fake hospital.

405
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:42,372
So much construction!

406
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:46,358
Oh, God, it's so late.

407
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:48,064
You guys are gonna bail on me, aren't you?

408
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:49,144
I think we have to Jeff.

409
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:51,342
We've tried everything we can.

410
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:54,982
Maybe over the weekend I can make a
fake building, but all the briefcases,

411
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:56,342
and the swapping, and The Sting?

412
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:57,942
I'm not cut out for it.

413
00:16:57,942 --> 00:17:00,284
I'm starting to think that real grifts
only really happen in the movies,

414
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:01,769
and even in the movies
they barely make sense.

415
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:02,745
Look, I'm old.

416
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:03,893
The Sting is terrible.

417
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:05,542
Grifting is stupid.

418
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:06,452
The writing's on the wall.

419
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:09,428
So that's it? There's
no shame in this, Jeff.

420
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,855
Oh, I don't know about that.

421
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:14,972
Well, this is a scene to behold.

422
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:17,810
Holed in the closet watching
The Sting like gypsies.

423
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,442
Roger, we surrender.

424
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:21,942
You were right.

425
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:23,622
I'm no grifter.

426
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:25,582
No, I was wrong.

427
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:28,067
If you remember, I called you a thug.

428
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:31,039
Thugs fight.

429
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,702
You're more, nope, I can't think of a
metaphor pathetic enough to suit you,

430
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:41,579
Jeff Winger, though I am reminded of
something Oscar Wilde once said when

431
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:43,562
he compared sheep to wolves.

432
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,636
Screw it.

433
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:52,275
You hit me with a woman's hand.

434
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:54,353
You Midwestern floozy.

435
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:55,433
I lived in New York.

436
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,112
Aah!

437
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:16,238
Aah!

438
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:18,631
Aah!

439
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,475
Aah!

440
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,554
Yeah, right, he's grifting us.

441
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:27,651
Grift blood.

442
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:28,778
Someone taste it.

443
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:30,903
I'm sure it's Karo Syrup and food dye.

444
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:34,886
I mean I would, but my diabetes.

445
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:46,480
19, 20, 21.

446
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,938
Are you counting the amount of
money or the number of stacks?

447
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,420
I have to start over.

448
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,463
I'll do it, move.

449
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:03,712
But I want to go on record as
being disgusted by this transaction.

450
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:04,617
Got it.

451
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:05,650
Disgusted.

452
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,774
I, I'm sorry love, but would
you rather we took this to court?

453
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:09,744
No, no, no, no, no.

454
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:13,564
We appreciate you keeping this
between us and I do want to remind you

455
00:19:13,564 --> 00:19:16,459
that we offer a lot of classes
and many of them are cash only.

456
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,855
Me, take a class here?

457
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:19,016
Talk about a rip-off.

458
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:21,258
Oh!

459
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:23,546
Talk about a ribbing.

460
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,797
What the hell am I doing?

461
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:29,824
You know, so far, Frankie's
disgusted and, that's it.

462
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:32,784
Seems like a waste of a record.

463
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:33,504
So sorry guys.

464
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:34,904
This is all my fault.

465
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:37,284
Don't be. I'm the one who
got in a pissing match.

466
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:39,074
With a jerk.

467
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:39,944
You're a jerk.

468
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:40,824
You're a jerk.

469
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:41,844
You're a jerk.

470
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:43,404
You're all jerks.

471
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:45,794
And this whole school can suck a big one.

472
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:47,004
And you can put that in your record.

473
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:50,049
I'm sorry, guys, I'm bound by my station.

474
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:54,424
Speaking on that topic, Britta, this
is all your fault and you're expelled.

475
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:55,632
What, what? No, Dean.

476
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:57,382
Let, let, let, let, let me handle this.

477
00:19:57,382 --> 00:19:59,612
No, you can't do that.

478
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:02,029
Britta's the heart of this group.

479
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:05,433
She started it as a,
as a, as a, as a, as a,

480
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:11,247
as a fake biology group so that
she could have sex with Troy.

481
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:12,202
No. That's exactly it.

482
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:13,352
Oh, okay.

483
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:14,452
Don't let me handle it.

484
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:17,578
No. You can't expel Britta,
she's been here six years.

485
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:19,702
Three more, and she'll
have her two-year degree.

486
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:21,535
Britta keeps me grounded in reality.

487
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:24,132
You can't expel her with four
week-isodes left in the seaso-mester.

488
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:24,869
See, it's starting.

489
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:26,077
It's okay, guys.

490
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:27,410
It's okay.

491
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,660
All right.

492
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,785
50,000.

493
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:33,870
Whoop, I'll just put this in here.

494
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,910
Mm-hm.

495
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,410
Give it to me.

496
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,160
Yep.

497
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,327
Don't help me, anyone.

498
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:40,535
Turn me around.

499
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:49,241
See you later.

500
00:20:53,652 --> 00:21:02,494
Hey!

501
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,327
The plan was to meet later.

502
00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:08,827
So, what's it gonna
cost to make you go away?

503
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:11,508
You're know there's a way we
could end this very quickly and

504
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:12,410
make a bit of money.

505
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,661
I don't like it, but keep talking.

506
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:17,119
Yes. That was the plan.

507
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,494
And, your plan was
probably to never show up.

508
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:20,744
Clever girl.

509
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:22,244
Don't trust anyone.

510
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:30,864
Ooh, ooh.

511
00:21:33,953 --> 00:21:36,160
Hang on Did you have to hit me, for real?

512
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,036
Have to?

513
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:37,536
No.

514
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:43,044
Now that you're expelled, you
might consider a career in grifting.

515
00:21:43,044 --> 00:21:44,064
You're quite good at it.

516
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,914
I don't know. How does one
go through life like that?

517
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:52,369
Well, follow me, and I'll show you.

518
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:53,452
Oh, shut up.

519
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:02,020
I only agreed to any of this to
get you away from Greendale and

520
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,286
out of Jeff's hair.

521
00:22:03,286 --> 00:22:07,327
He's an idiot, but I hate watching
him spin out trying to beat you.

522
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,119
You sentimental fool.

523
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,660
Later at the motel.

524
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,619
The motel.

525
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:16,077
Mm.

526
00:22:16,077 --> 00:22:19,369
Some say I'm a lucky grifter.

527
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:22,827
Some say I'm the king.

528
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:27,119
They call me the lucky grifter.

529
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,452
They call me the King of England.

530
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:31,828
I am the king.

531
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:37,869
No.

532
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:43,619
What the hell?

533
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:47,494
Oh, shut up.

534
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,841
The only reason I agreed to any
of this was to get you away from

535
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:56,619
Greendale and out of Jeff's hair.

536
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:59,202
What the?

537
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:05,244
You two, come back here!

538
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:06,702
Briefcases.

539
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:07,994
Coming right through.

540
00:23:07,994 --> 00:23:09,577
Identical briefcases.

541
00:23:09,577 --> 00:23:10,202
What?

542
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:12,673
Why more briefcases?

543
00:23:12,673 --> 00:23:15,410
This is pointless!

544
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,619
I already know she's got my briefcase!

545
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,327
Briefcase parade!

546
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:24,202
Who the hell are you?

547
00:23:25,243 --> 00:23:28,577
You get back here.

548
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:30,660
You get back here with my money.

549
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,410
Get back here!

550
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,160
Oh, Roger.

551
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,119
They stole my money.

552
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,035
What?

553
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:52,785
What?

554
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:53,702
Those briefcases contain my money.

555
00:23:53,702 --> 00:23:55,827
They stole $50,000 from me.

556
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:57,994
50 grand, huh?

557
00:23:57,994 --> 00:23:59,535
You guys know what he's talking about?

558
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:00,577
I don't think so.

559
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:03,452
These are our briefcases.

560
00:24:03,452 --> 00:24:04,119
What is grifting class.

561
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,035
He sells these supplies.

562
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:05,910
150 bucks.

563
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,499
Really?

564
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:07,074
Uh-huh.

565
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:07,944
Okay.

566
00:24:07,944 --> 00:24:08,994
We are still rolling.

567
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:10,660
We got pretty good at it, too.

568
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,202
Check it out.

569
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:12,786
Ow.

570
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,535
Ow, sorry. Sorry.

571
00:24:14,535 --> 00:24:16,244
Okay.

572
00:24:16,244 --> 00:24:20,952
Okay. Roger, why were you
walking around with $50,000?

573
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:22,327
Are you mental?

574
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,535
Hey, whoa pal.

575
00:24:23,535 --> 00:24:26,744
That usage may fly in
the UK, not in the States.

576
00:24:26,744 --> 00:24:29,994
I have a mentally challenged cousin.

577
00:24:29,994 --> 00:24:31,077
Sister.

578
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:31,827
Pics.

579
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:32,844
I wanna see pics.

580
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:35,765
Okay, you do. You know
very well that this school

581
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:40,035
paid me $50,000 in cash for these injuries.

582
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:41,659
Well, you seem to be in pretty good shape.

583
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:42,910
No, oh, my god!

584
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,702
Look at the two of you!

585
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:46,827
Yeah, he's the reason I became a cop.

586
00:24:46,827 --> 00:24:49,827
You know, a lot of bullies out there.

587
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:52,633
There are a million witnesses to this.

588
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:53,590
Hey, everyone.

589
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,800
Hey guys, just hanging
out in the cafeteria?

590
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,840
Hi profess... oh, what
happened to your face?

591
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,674
This is ridiculous.

592
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:00,465
Aw. She's beautiful.

593
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,757
You could be twins.

594
00:25:02,757 --> 00:25:06,304
So, the statement I'm hearing here
is you're a grifting professor.

595
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,654
Yeah. You're teaching these
people how to grift but

596
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:11,554
you're saying they grifted you.

597
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:12,664
No, you id.

598
00:25:12,664 --> 00:25:14,044
I'm not saying that.

599
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:15,924
They didn't grift me.

600
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:17,344
What they do is not grifting.

601
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:19,694
They wouldn't even understand
what the word meant.

602
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:25,268
I think we need to take what
Roger's saying more seriously.

603
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:25,918
Oh.

604
00:25:25,918 --> 00:25:31,724
Because it sounds like he was either
the victim of crass, artless thuggery.

605
00:25:31,724 --> 00:25:32,264
Correct.

606
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:37,445
In which case, there really is
$50,000 floating around that he was

607
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:42,804
given for clearly fake injuries, and
that he therefore now owes the school.

608
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:43,603
What?

609
00:25:43,603 --> 00:25:48,353
Or Professor DeSalvo was targeted
by a group of people he vastly

610
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:52,482
underestimated, in which
case the money was given and

611
00:25:52,482 --> 00:25:56,994
then taken back and nobody
owes anybody anything.

612
00:25:56,994 --> 00:26:01,262
All he would have to do is admit.

613
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,810
I was grifted.

614
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:15,565
Grift, grift, grift, grift,
grift, grift, grift, grift.

615
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:16,924
Why are you even here?

616
00:26:16,924 --> 00:26:18,024
Who called you?

617
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:19,274
Nobody.

618
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:22,138
I take macrame after work, they know that.

619
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:25,918
Sorry you got grifted, let me know
if you want to press charges and

620
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,175
if you could think of what those would be.

621
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:32,027
Professor DeSalvo, under the
circumstances I'm sure you agree it doesn't

622
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:35,324
makes sense for you to keep
teaching this subject here.

623
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:38,305
Yeah, I mean, we kinda know
everything there is to know.

624
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,664
You should probably
refund all their money and

625
00:26:40,664 --> 00:26:42,426
we should all go get some hot dogs.

626
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:43,308
Hot dogs.

627
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:44,724
Hot dogs.

628
00:26:44,724 --> 00:26:45,583
Hot dogs.

629
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,466
Hot dogs.

630
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:47,348
Hot dogs.

631
00:26:47,348 --> 00:26:48,114
Hot dogs.

632
00:26:48,114 --> 00:26:48,997
Hot dogs.

633
00:26:48,997 --> 00:26:49,949
Hot dogs.

634
00:26:49,949 --> 00:26:50,901
Hot dogs.

635
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:51,783
Hot dogs.

636
00:26:51,783 --> 00:26:52,665
Hot dogs.

637
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:53,640
Hot dogs.

638
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,804
Hot dogs.

639
00:26:55,804 --> 00:26:58,004
We were all in it the whole time?

640
00:26:58,004 --> 00:26:58,694
You weren't.

641
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:02,494
Because I can't be trusted.

642
00:27:03,512 --> 00:27:04,185
Hot dogs.

643
00:27:04,185 --> 00:27:04,998
Hot dogs.

644
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,787
Hot dogs.

645
00:27:05,787 --> 00:27:06,693
Hot dogs.

646
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:07,528
Hot dogs.

647
00:27:07,528 --> 00:27:08,341
Hot dogs.

648
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:10,013
Hot dogs.

649
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:13,177
Telegram for Mr Winger.

650
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:14,171
Hey, Ridley.

651
00:27:14,171 --> 00:27:16,361
So, I returned the telegram
man outfit to the dean.

652
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:18,181
Thank you so much.

653
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:19,601
I know how crazy this week's been.

654
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:21,101
You really didn't have to do this.

655
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:21,971
Are you kidding?

656
00:27:21,971 --> 00:27:22,681
I owe you.

657
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:23,511
Whatever you need.

658
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:24,381
Just say the word.

659
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:27,631
All right. I could use your help
moving a mattress this weekend.

660
00:27:29,091 --> 00:27:29,991
Okay, cool.

661
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:30,841
Is that okay?

662
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:31,638
Let me know.

663
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:36,421
My name is Ryan Ridley.

664
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:40,151
Three years ago my life was
saved by a stranger at my gym.

665
00:27:40,151 --> 00:27:41,987
I felt like I owed him my In life.

666
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:44,711
Apparently he agreed.

667
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:47,101
Now he has me do things,
and I keep hoping and

668
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:50,621
praying that one day I'll do
enough for him to call us even.

669
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:54,431
Until then, I'm just a guy from his gym.

Did you get any of that?
