00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:05,155
The Simpsons S19E05 (JABF16 )
Treehouse of Horror XVIII

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,184
Hello.
Remember Halloween?

3
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:09,428
It was last week.

4
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:12,843
But here at the Simpson house,
we're still celebrating.

5
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:18,235
Tonight, we have
three terrifying tales of the...

6
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:19,612
Excuse me.

7
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:24,543
Now, our first gory story is...

8
00:00:24,544 --> 00:00:26,579
Oh, for crying out loud!

9
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:30,295
No fair.

10
00:00:30,536 --> 00:00:34,370
Can't anyone just watch the
show they're watching?

11
00:00:49,764 --> 00:00:51,646
Dinner is served.

12
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:10,326
Mmm. Developed by.

13
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:19,570
Crème brulée!

14
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:20,871
Crème brulée!

15
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:21,751
Or, in English:

16
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:22,921
Burnt cream!

17
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:24,193
Burnt cream!

18
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:24,972
Hold on.

19
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:26,832
I still have to caramelize.

20
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:30,092
Bart, go out to the shed

21
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:31,990
and get some more butane!

22
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:36,203
...butane this.

23
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,263
What's that unearthly glow?

24
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:46,762
The only sensible thing to do
is explore it on my own.

25
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:50,813
Huh?

26
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:57,591
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:58,622
An alien...

28
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:01,141
in our butane storage shed.

29
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:03,591
Is that your space name?

30
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:07,352
No, you hit me in
my 700 testicles.

31
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,691
Why did you come
to our world?

32
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:11,760
My friends and I came in peace

33
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,821
to find your vulnerabilities

34
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:14,822
and, um,

35
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:17,291
shore them up
with more peace.

36
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:18,123
Yes.

37
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:21,140
Then I was accidentally
left behind...

38
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:23,233
in a spirit of peace.

39
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:25,592
Is that a ray gun?

40
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:27,363
No, it's a...

41
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:29,721
deodorant applicator.

42
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:30,770
I'll just...

43
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:38,243
Smells like a
summer breeze.

44
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:43,343
So, this is my Krusty
dolll0o, Linguo,

45
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:44,931
Iraq War Sergeant Activity

46
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:46,132
with insufficient armor,

47
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:48,041
Phonic Frog, cat skull,

48
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:49,773
Jim Halterman bobblehead doll.

49
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:51,073
He's a local car dealer.

50
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:51,950
Hmm...

51
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,303
do all humans
have such weak necks

52
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:57,302
or just the one you call
"Jim Halterman"?

53
00:02:57,695 --> 00:02:59,280
Oh, my God, an alien.

54
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:02,301
I'm going to blow Rachel
Goodman away at show-and-tell.

55
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,153
No. If the government
finds out he's here,

56
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:05,242
they'll dissect him.

57
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:08,723
I only hope those scientists
leave me my mouth,

58
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,381
so I may spread my message

59
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:12,091
of peace through song.

60
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:15,073
Peace...

61
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:17,601
Peace, peace, peace

62
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:19,252
From space.

63
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:21,210
As this month's
rotating president

64
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:24,071
of the Springfield
Future Scientists Club,

65
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,122
may I say I'm sorry

66
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:28,181
and is there anything
we can do to help?

67
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:31,562
Well, I would
like to phone home

68
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:34,081
to tell my family I'm okay.

69
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:37,651
To do so, I would need
the following items.

70
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:38,680
Get them now.

71
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,391
Fiber-optic cable,

72
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:42,313
uranium 235,

73
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:43,872
two tickets to Avenue Q,

74
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:45,813
seven billion body bags...

75
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:47,511
Can I hammer that?

76
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:47,940
No.

77
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:48,761
Can I weld that?

78
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:49,243
No!

79
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:49,910
Can I tighten the...

80
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,071
I said no!

81
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:52,842
I thought we were supposed
to do this together.

82
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:55,831
Actually, I do have an
important job for you.

83
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,311
You can go get the
wrench I dropped.

84
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:00,862
I'm helping! I'm helping!

85
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:02,571
Way to getrid of Bart.

86
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,981
He can be such a pest.

87
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:07,032
You are very observant, Lisa.

88
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:10,161
That's why I have
a special job for you.

89
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:12,182
Go find out the
secret locations

90
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:14,951
of your country'smissile
defense facilities.

91
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,140
They were in yesterday's
New York Times.

92
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:21,993
We'll be killing every human in two days

93
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:25,031
We'll be killing every human in two days

94
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:27,033
We will cook them, we will eat them

95
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:29,141
'Cause that's the way to treat them...

96
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:30,961
Oh, Ma-arge.

97
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:32,661
Want some company?

98
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:36,433
As always, silence means yes.

99
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:40,021
How about a little
neck rub, baby?

100
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,022
Now, how about the
neck of my butt?

101
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,420
Oh-ho-ho!

102
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:49,430
Someone's taking the highway
to the danger zone.

103
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:52,800
Oh, Marge,your tentacles feel so good.

104
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:54,631
Wait a minute.

105
00:04:54,696 --> 00:04:57,692
Why am I getting
words in edgewise?

106
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,721
We can't have a space creature
living in our house.

107
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:05,221
Go ahead. Say it.

108
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:07,261
It's because I'm Jewish.

109
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,601
No, no, no, some of
my best friends are...

110
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:11,662
Fine, you can stay.

111
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,512
Look!

112
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:14,051
They're coming to get...

113
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:14,702
what's your name?

114
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:16,262
Kodos the Destroyer.

115
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:16,751
Huh?

116
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:17,520
Don't worry, son.

117
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:19,921
I got a planto save your space doggy.

118
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,000
Who is it?

119
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:24,701
Ma'am, we have reason to believe

120
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:25,930
that you're harboring an alien.

121
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:27,281
Open this doorat once.

122
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:28,991
Oh, I'm not decent.

123
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,490
Let me throw something on.

124
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:34,202
Can I help you, gentlemen?

125
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:36,962
Uh, we know it'syou, Mr. Simpson.

126
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,051
Now where is the alien?

127
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:39,813
Wow, you guys are good.

128
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:41,510
The alien's right here
in the living room.

129
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,370
Ha! You missed 'em.

130
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:47,063
Bart and our alien friend are

131
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:49,301
hundreds of miles away by now.

132
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,022
What do you weigh?

133
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:55,332
Like a million pounds?

134
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:56,931
More of meto love.

135
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:57,871
After them!

136
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:01,702
The South shall rise again.

137
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:17,081
We can fly over them with
the power of love, right?

138
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:20,253
Hmm... we could, or...

139
00:06:25,438 --> 00:06:26,803
You killed them.

140
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:28,852
Well done, Columbo.

141
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:31,142
That's right. We watch Columbo.

142
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:34,560
It's on during rain-outs
of gleep-glop games.

143
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:37,660
I'm just gonna take off now.

144
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,476
I'm sure you have a lot
of calls to make.

145
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,036
Foolish biped.

146
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:42,390
It's not a phone.

147
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,080
It's a space portal.

148
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:46,340
Our shock troops will teleportin

149
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,503
and eat everyone's heads,

150
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:50,312
all thanks to you.

151
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:18,331
What did I miss?

152
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:22,501
Hop in, Bart.

153
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:24,070
They're gonna let us kill one!

154
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:32,683
Bart... friend?

155
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:40,522
Homer... bored!

156
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:45,891
I can't believe that
an alien who looked

157
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,641
so evil turned out to be bad.

158
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:51,311
Hmm. I guess you should
judge a book by its cover.

159
00:07:51,318 --> 00:07:53,223
Definitely, especially if you count

160
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:55,221
the inside flap as part of the cover.

161
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:57,250
It usually gives you a great idea

162
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,621
of what the book's about.

163
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,152
Quiet.

164
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:01,093
We're missing the dissection!

165
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:03,352
Actually, I'm still alive,

166
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:05,420
so technically, it's vivisection.

167
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:07,181
No one likes a know-it-all.

168
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:30,023
You see, the problem
is we've grown apart.

169
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:31,921
The problem is

170
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:34,010
you don't share my interest

171
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:35,331
in not being with you.

172
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:36,242
Another thing:

173
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,222
I don't knowwhere you go at night.

174
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:00,922
Greetings, 241.

175
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:03,033
Why does he always bring up my weight?

176
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:05,592
I want you to eliminate this reporter,

177
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:06,802
Kent Brockman.

178
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,413
He found the gully where I dump

179
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,862
electricity every summer

180
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:11,053
to jack up prices.

181
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:11,793
Don't worry, sir.

182
00:09:11,797 --> 00:09:13,153
I'll handle this cleanly,

183
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:14,661
quietly and... Bart!

184
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:15,831
What?

185
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:18,800
Marge, I'm gonna behome late tonight.

186
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:20,132
I'm going to, uh...

187
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:23,783
Midnight Monkey
Madness at the zoo.

188
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:25,250
Well, I won'tbe home, either.

189
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:26,421
I'm, um...

190
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:29,421
flipping overwheelbarrows in case it rains.

191
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:31,620
Have funat your crazy-sounding thing.

192
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,923
And you have fun at
your preposterous event.

193
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:34,730
- Love ya.
- Love ya.

194
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:37,903
And that was my drink.

195
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:43,051
Ninth floor.

196
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:44,281
Assassin's perch.

197
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,113
Now all I have to do is think of a

198
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:03,572
clever line before I pull the trigger.

199
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:06,492
Oh, that's a perfect one.

200
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:09,102
But I don't need to say it
out loud 'cause I'm by myself.

201
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:16,490
Out of my way, mystery skank!

202
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,772
Hey! Now I don't get paid!

203
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:25,742
Hey, baby, hello.

204
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,132
Now I'm mad!

205
00:10:38,365 --> 00:10:40,102
Now I'm...

206
00:10:50,197 --> 00:10:52,440
Marge is a professional assassin!

207
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,830
You just can't get
Russian gangster blood out.

208
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:03,110
Must be something they eat.

209
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,331
Hey, what's that?

210
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,602
A blender cozy.

211
00:11:13,877 --> 00:11:16,642
How was your Midnight
Monkey Madness?

212
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:17,983
Great, great.

213
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:21,100
I turned over so many wheelbarrows...

214
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:22,540
Wait. That was your thing.

215
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:28,103
Homie,

216
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,771
I made you my killer lasagna.

217
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:32,341
It's poison!

218
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:34,401
Whatever you do, don't eat it.

219
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,652
Okay, you' already eating it,
but don't finish it.

220
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:41,792
Okay, you finished it,
but don't ask for...

221
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:42,681
Seconds, please.

222
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:44,311
You moron!
Just kill her!

223
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,503
I'll kill her after dessert!

224
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:52,052
You're a killer for hire!

225
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:53,461
You ruined that pie!

226
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:57,363
How could you not tell me
you were an assassin?

227
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,293
How could you not tell me?

228
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:03,042
I told you 20 times!

229
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:04,171
You never listen!

230
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,712
Well, they're not
as pretty as you, Marge.

231
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,342
Listen, I...
Oh!

232
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:31,811
Okay, here's the deal.

233
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:33,413
I'll do the killing for hire,

234
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:34,892
and you stay home with the kids.

235
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:38,422
I get $50,000 a hit.

236
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:39,641
How much do you make?

237
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:41,870
I just get to keep
whatever's in the guy's wallet.

238
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:47,661
All those nights I thought
you were out getting drunk,

239
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:49,711
you were out killing people?!

240
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,321
I was out getting drunk,
then killing people!

241
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:13,410
Stop it!

242
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:14,882
That's my favorite couch!

243
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,731
Why do you think I'm kicking it?

244
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,562
Are you guys fighting over us?

245
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:24,231
Whatever we did, we're sorry.

246
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:27,491
Sweeties...

247
00:13:28,397 --> 00:13:29,561
We weren't fighting.

248
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:30,842
It sounded like you were.

249
00:13:30,997 --> 00:13:32,983
Who wants ice cream in bed?

250
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:34,582
Ice cream! Ice cream!

251
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:35,683
Dad's the best!

252
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:38,531
Great! Now they're going to have
tummy aches tomorrow.

253
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:40,841
And where will
"Super Dad" be then?

254
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:42,393
At your funeral.

255
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:50,001
We got a complaint from
an anonymous "neighborino"

256
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:53,811
about an elaborately choreographed,
high-octane, ultra-fight.

257
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:57,022
I would have taken a bribe.

258
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,231
Oh, that was so hot!

259
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:03,032
I love watching you do other guys!

260
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,372
Mmm, I'd like to see you
do a guy sometime.

261
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:08,280
That can be arranged.

262
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:21,171
Oh, what a wonderful night.

263
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:27,462
...so, killing people together
has really spiced things up

264
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:28,643
in the bedroom.

265
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,721
That's terrific,
but I called you here to discuss

266
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,852
your son's misbehavior
on the school bus.

267
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:37,873
Think of me on Pizza Fridays.

268
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:53,351
Trick or treat!

269
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:56,672
Beat it, weirdoes!
I don't do Halloween!

270
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:59,152
You're supposed
to give us candy.

271
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:01,400
I got your candy right here.

272
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:04,890
Weirdoes!

273
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:06,751
She empty-bagged us!

274
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:07,923
What do we do now?

275
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:08,953
Hear me out.

276
00:15:09,145 --> 00:15:11,942
It seems to me we gave her
a choice: trick or treat.

277
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:14,070
She didn't give us a treat, so...

278
00:15:14,276 --> 00:15:16,021
Bart, where are
you heading with this?

279
00:15:16,258 --> 00:15:18,203
"Trick or Treat" isn't
just some phrase you chant

280
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:20,203
mindlessly like The Lord's Prayer.

281
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,690
It's an oral contract!

282
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,870
You're right.
We've forgotten the old ways.

283
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:26,573
The ways of rotten eggs
and soaped-up windows.

284
00:15:26,797 --> 00:15:28,323
I say we trick her!

285
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:29,773
Trick her good!

286
00:15:30,177 --> 00:15:31,291
Yay!

287
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:40,423
May I remind you that I'm

288
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:41,800
your principal's mother?!

289
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:52,563
I hope the next people
don't give us anything

290
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:54,313
so we can trick them too!

291
00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:55,360
Why give 'em a choice?

292
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:58,090
That trick was sweeter than any
treat we'll get tonight.

293
00:15:58,365 --> 00:16:00,631
I'm concerned we might be
heading down a slippery slope.

294
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:02,161
What do you think, Nelson?

295
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:04,241
Can't talk.
Lighting poo.

296
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:07,242
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

297
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:10,062
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

298
00:16:10,518 --> 00:16:12,710
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

299
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:15,513
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

300
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:17,391
<i>They're forming in straight line</i>

301
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:20,161
<i>They're going through a tight wind</i>

302
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:22,863
<i>The kids are losing their minds</i>

303
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,643
<i>The blitzkrieg bop</i>

304
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:27,680
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

305
00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:38,523
Excuse me, but this is not good!

306
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,343
Oh, lighten up.
It's Halloween.

307
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:42,420
A night for mischief and merriment.

308
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:45,350
Trick-or-treat!
Lick my feet!

309
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:47,501
! taem ttub-gip ekilsllems daeh ruoY

310
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:50,951
Those monsters must be stopped!

311
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:52,920
Perhaps, I can be
of some assistance.

312
00:16:56,696 --> 00:17:00,053
I've got something that will scare the
H-E-double sippy straws out of them.

313
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:04,642
Hold still!

314
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:12,240
How is this a prank?
Give me back my TV!

315
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:13,740
I fed your fish.

316
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:14,953
You overfed them!

317
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:16,420
You're the worst one of all!

318
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:27,193
Whoa! They turned the church
into a haunted house!

319
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:29,422
"Scaredy cats not wanted"?

320
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,071
Then I am wanted!

321
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:37,093
Welcome to Heck House!

322
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:38,682
You're about to discover

323
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:40,073
what a life of sin will get you!

324
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:42,443
Sin gets us something?
Awesome!

325
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,200
I was just in it for the sin.

326
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,491
Just get in there!

327
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:50,002
Welcome to eternal darnation!

328
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:53,652
May I have a clean American
newspaper, please,

329
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:55,022
no "Doonesbury"?

330
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:58,580
Wouldn't you rather have
a bikini magazine?

331
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:00,503
I guess a little peek won't hurt me.

332
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:02,453
No!

333
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:05,853
He died as he lived--like a dork.

334
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:10,302
No! The lesson here is
he's being punished

335
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,940
for thinking women are beautiful!

336
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:16,392
Please, Lord, grant me the power

337
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:18,930
to psychologically torture them
into loving you.

338
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:26,400
Behold, the
las-diddily-ast room

339
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,813
of Ned Flanders's Hell House!

340
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,273
I warned ya.

341
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:36,742
And yet my punishment
is no less severe.

342
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:37,822
That's odd.

343
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:50,553
Springfield is rife
with the seven deadly sins!

344
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:52,570
Starting with... gluttony!

345
00:19:02,957 --> 00:19:03,933
More bread, please.

346
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:07,643
Anger!

347
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:12,332
Why won't you work,
you stupid piece of junk?!

348
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:20,933
I said, why won't you work?!

349
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:25,310
Pride!

350
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:31,433
Oh, why did I take pride
in my child's accomplishments?

351
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:33,632
Sloth!

352
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:37,450
I thought I was killed
by that magic spaghetti!

353
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:42,391
And the rest!

354
00:19:43,468 --> 00:19:44,463
Lust!

355
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:48,182
Greed!

356
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:52,063
And envy!

357
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:53,983
Oh, how I envy the crotchless.

358
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:57,263
And this is where sinners spend
all of eternity!

359
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,160
This is what you get
for stealing jokes?!

360
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:06,202
I keep telling you: I'm Hindu!

361
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:08,030
I regret... nothing.

362
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:10,733
- Stop licking my junk!
- It's my junk, too!

363
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:14,581
We'll never do any of those sins...

364
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:15,903
I promise!

365
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:19,333
All we'll do from now on
is pray and fight in wars.

366
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,060

00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:27,450

that for watching this network,
