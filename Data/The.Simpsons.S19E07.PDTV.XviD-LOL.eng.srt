1
00:00:06,248 --> 00:00:09,280
The Simpsons S19E07 (JABF17)
Husbands and Knives

2
00:00:14,387 --> 00:00:16,823
The pilgrims were not
illegal aliens

3
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:22,543
Lame, lame,

4
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:25,383
lame, lame, have it, lame,

5
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:28,204
Superman Dies, Aquaman Dies,
Casper Dies,

6
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:31,155
Caveman Robin, Black Robin,
Born-Again Robin.

7
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:35,442
The infamous Wolverine comic
with pop-out claws.

8
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:37,681
Why was this
so controversial?

9
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,112
Nice work,
Doctor Boo-Who.

10
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:47,030
Your tears have smudged
Wolverine's iconic sideburns.

11
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:48,982
Hence, you must buy this comic.

12
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:52,544
And the cost of your
innocent accident is...

13
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,853
$25, please.

14
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:57,003
But that's the money Yaya Sofia

15
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,001
gave me for Greek
Orthodox Easter.

16
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:02,493
I hate when they tell me
things about themselves.

17
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,592
You should stop being
so mean to us kids.

18
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:06,532
Well, I suppose you could buy

19
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:08,030
your comics somewhere else.

20
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,411
Maybe they sell comics
at the dry cleaners.

21
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,010
No?

22
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:13,403
Perhaps they sell comics
at the mattress store

23
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:14,051
No!

24
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:16,382
Perhaps you could buy your
comics at that new

25
00:02:16,398 --> 00:02:18,791
comic bookstore
across the street?

26
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:20,411
Philip K. Dick.

27
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:21,312
It can't be.

28
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:22,400
It's as if Superman

29
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,552
moved to Gotham City.

30
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:27,553
Which he did,
in World's Finest Comics n°24.

31
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:28,451
See.

32
00:02:28,508 --> 00:02:30,330
That was an imaginary
story dreamt

33
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:32,700
by Jimmy Olsen after he
was kicked in the head

34
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:34,091
by Supergirl's horse, Comet.

35
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:35,163
It never really happened.

36
00:02:35,178 --> 00:02:37,480
None of these things
ever really happened.

37
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:40,041
Get out of my store.

38
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:43,682
Grand opening!

39
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,151
Hey what up, you guys?

40
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:51,081
How g-g-g-goes it?

41
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:52,371
My name's Milo,

42
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:54,080
and this is Coolsville.

43
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,650
Now listen, before everyone chills

44
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:57,702
with some sweet comic B's,

45
00:02:57,705 --> 00:02:59,081
everyone gets a free piece

46
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:00,671
of Japanese hard candy.

47
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:01,570
One for you.

48
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:02,662
Short kid in back.

49
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:03,561
Down low.

50
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:04,331
Go long.

51
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:05,991
I got prawn.

52
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:08,061
Mmm.

53
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,472
I got miso.

54
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:11,641
Mmm.

55
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:13,240
I got dolphin.

56
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:16,462
Now, I hope you
all like Korean

57
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,822
pop covers of
Tom Jones songs,

58
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:20,753
'cause they're about
to be blasted.

59
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,801
<i>Hanyong, pussycat?</i>

60
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:25,720
<i>Wah, wah, wah-ah...</i>

61
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,650
<i>Hanyong, pussycat...</i>

62
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:29,073
<i>Wah, wah,</i>

63
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:31,093
<i>wah-aaaaaaaaaaah...</i>

64
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:35,381
<i>pussycat, pussycat,</i>

65
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,732
Asterix!

66
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:47,612
Tintin!

67
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:48,893
I heard these only existed

68
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,900
in high school French classes.

69
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:55,690
Come on, Snowy, we
must save the Belgian

70
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:57,640
ambassador from
the Black Orchid Gang.

71
00:03:58,508 --> 00:03:59,383
What's that?

72
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:00,790
A sound of ignition?

73
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,012
Zut, alors!

74
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:06,892
This castle is actually
a four-stage rocket

75
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:09,811
and it's headed straight
for the Pompidou Center.

76
00:04:13,397 --> 00:04:14,790
Oh, no, I ripped it.

77
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:17,452
Hey, no worries,
little lady.

78
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:20,161
These books are meant to
be read and enjoyed,

79
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:23,021
not hoarded and then sold
when you get divorced.

80
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:25,381
Wow!
He's so cool.

81
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:27,290
All right,
I get it.

82
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:29,772
You're cool,
you're not "mainstream,"

83
00:04:29,778 --> 00:04:31,593
You wear a porkpie hat.

84
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,401
Mmm... porkpie.

85
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,513
But let's see what you know
about superheroes.

86
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,442
Hey, I'm all about
the capes.

87
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:40,510
Flame on.

88
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:42,243
Who's stronger?
The Thung or The Mulk?

89
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:43,293
And show your work.

90
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,130
Whoa, oh, head rush.

91
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:45,810
Okay,

92
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:49,352
well, the Mulk kicked a
tidal wave into the sun,

93
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:50,280
whereas...

94
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:54,491
The Thung gave a piggyback
ride to the 1985 Chicago Bears.

95
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:56,501
Hoo, boy, that's a tough one.

96
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:58,193
What do you think?

97
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,053
You want to know what I think?

98
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,981
Does Galactus eat planets?

99
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:04,023
Of course I do.

100
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:04,892
Wow.

101
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:08,021
I was in such a bad relationship
with my ex-Comic Book Guy,

102
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:09,980
I'd forgotten how good it could be.

103
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:11,923
Mmm.

104
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:14,680
Bye, Bart.

105
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,452
Enjoy your funny books.

106
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:19,781
Look, Maggie,

107
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,810
I'm Wonder Woman.

108
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:23,513
Oh.

109
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:25,131
I've lost my perfect

110
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:27,871
26-26-26 figure.

111
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:30,891
Never compare yourself to a standee.

112
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,882
Hey, you're way skinnier
than a lot of superheroes.

113
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:35,913
Girthquake, Flaberella.

114
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:36,842
Kearney's Mom.

115
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:37,443
Shut up!

116
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:39,490
Her depression medication
makes her bloated.

117
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:41,520
She's depressed 'cause you're so lame.

118
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:42,320
Shut up!

119
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:46,560
Ooh, I'd better join a gym

120
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,013
before I go from hippy to hippo.

121
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,132
I wish my Mom said
cute things like that.

122
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:52,641
She can't 'cause she's depressed.

123
00:05:52,655 --> 00:05:53,441
Shut up.

124
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:01,510
Look at all these alternative
comic book creators.

125
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:02,601
Alan Moore,

126
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:03,941
Art Spiegelman.

127
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,471
Oh, Dan Clowes.

128
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:09,421
I really identified with
the girls in Ghost World.

129
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:12,183
They made me feel
like I wasn't so alone.

130
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:13,841
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

131
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:16,002
Do you know anyone who works at Batman?

132
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:18,561
'Cause I really want to draw Batman.

133
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:21,053
I'm awesome at utility belts.

134
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:22,072
Check these out.

135
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:24,171
This is where the Batman
keeps his money

136
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:26,170
in case he has to
take the bus.

137
00:06:27,777 --> 00:06:28,700
Alan Moore,

138
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:31,702
you wrote my favorite
issues of Radioactive Man.

139
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:32,880
Oh, really.

140
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:34,503
So you'd like that I made your

141
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:37,030
favorite superhero a heroin-addicted

142
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:39,640
jazz critic who's not radioactive?

143
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:40,690
I don't read the words.

144
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,372
I just like when he
punches people.

145
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:44,944
How do you make his costume
stick so close this muscles?

146
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:47,853
Mr. Moore,

147
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:51,302
will you sign my DVD of Watchmen Babies?

148
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:53,823
Which of the babies
is your favorite?

149
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:56,453
You see what those
bloody corporations do?

150
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:59,050
They take your ideas and they suck them!

151
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,541
Suck them like leeches
until they've gotten

152
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,652
every last drop of the
marrow from your bones!

153
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,690
Hey, Teacup,

154
00:07:05,696 --> 00:07:07,101
why don't you chill out?

155
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:09,300
Very well.

156
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:13,521
Oh, little Lulu,

157
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:17,153
I love you-lu, just the same.

158
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:18,532
Ah!

159
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:22,432
Attention, comic book aficionados!

160
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:24,752
This man is not one of us!

161
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:27,330
He has a girlfriend!

162
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:28,651
My name's Strawberry.

163
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,572
My purse is a lunchbox.

164
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:31,841
Now listen up,

165
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:34,021
my wayward little fanboys.

166
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:36,361
I have the most wonderful news.

167
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:39,891
My store now sells ninja weapons.

168
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:43,853
You would sell weapons
of the Orient to children?

169
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:45,292
That is weak.

170
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:46,902
Face the facts, has-been.

171
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,142
This man is the comic book

172
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:49,691
guy our town deserves.

173
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:50,463
Very well,

174
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,002
I guess the mature thing to do is...

175
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:00,891
Oh, no!

176
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,501
The store's in trouble!

177
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:05,361
League of Extraordinary Freelancers,

178
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:06,340
activate!

179
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:10,340
Maus is in the house!

180
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,280
How do ya like this punch line?

181
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:26,063
Ooh, L.A!

182
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:27,933
This could be the gym for me.

183
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:31,980
You're gonna get so ripped here.

184
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:34,473
We've got Tummy Tone with Sasha,

185
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:36,772
Power Bounce with Zach D.,

186
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,483
Zen Abs with Zach G.,

187
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:43,061
and you've just gotta try
Mommy and Me kickboxing!

188
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:56,600
Who thought walking
could be so difficult?

189
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:57,792
Well, I'm sure everyone else

190
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:59,442
is having trouble, too.

191
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:14,882
Maybe I'll just hit the showers.

192
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:21,822
Marge, you missed a spot.

193
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:26,732
Oh, I wish there was a gym

194
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:28,951
for us regular ladies.

195
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:42,500
"Rules: no men,

196
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:43,730
no cell phones,

197
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:45,643
no mirrors, no shame."

198
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:47,223
Marge, I wish you well,

199
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,842
but why would women
want to go to a gym if

200
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:53,482
there were no men there
watching them and judging them?

201
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,973
We're gonna be rich!

202
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:01,310
We can finally start a family!

203
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:02,670
We have a family.

204
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:04,210
A better one!

205
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:10,442
Switch stations!

206
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:13,480
I love this gym.

207
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,733
Me, too!

208
00:10:14,737 --> 00:10:16,713
Finally, an exercise bike

209
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:18,661
for women of a certain age

210
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:19,963
Jurassic!

211
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:26,851
Mom, every workout appointment
is booked up for months!

212
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:29,442
We'll have to open a second Shapes.

213
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:32,612
We just need to find a
vacant rental property.

214
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,470
I can't believe the labor

215
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:41,581
board is shutting me down!

216
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:43,682
You lock your workers in
at night.

217
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:47,470
It's so they can't tell their stories!

218
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:49,463
Mr. Krusty came
to my village.

219
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,200
He said he would marry me.

220
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:52,193
No ring!

221
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:54,162
Just fill apple
pies all day!

222
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:08,582
Today's guest created
the women's-only gym

223
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:11,343
that's taking the
tri-county area by storm:

224
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:12,610
Marge...

225
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:14,110
Simpson!

226
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:21,412
Marge, I thank you for creating Shapes

227
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,290
and, uh, my boyfriend thanks you, too.

228
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:29,242
When is Straightman
gonna pop the question?

229
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:33,923
You're all getting German cuckoo clocks!

230
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:35,790
And you're getting
a cuckoo clock!

231
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,820
And you're getting
a cuckoo clock!

232
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:39,750
And you're getting
a cuckoo clock!

233
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:41,892
And you're getting
a cuckoo clock!

234
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:49,841
Oh, yeah, Marge,

235
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:52,432
I love these business
trips of yours.

236
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:56,110
The TV remote isn't nailed on!

237
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:57,690
My whole life, I've never been

238
00:11:57,695 --> 00:11:59,842
in a hotel that trusted me.

239
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:09,483
Hors d'oeuvres,

240
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:10,732
big fancy desserts...

241
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:13,141
and my wife is paying
for everything.

242
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:15,952
Now I know why pimps are so happy.

243
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:18,882
Yep, nothing beats
living on "wife-support."

244
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,040
I hear that.

245
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,313
Yo guys, come meet a new husband!

246
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:25,402
Hey, how ya doin'?

247
00:12:25,406 --> 00:12:26,212
I'm Homer.

248
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:28,092
My wife invented a gym for

249
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:29,852
"regular" women.

250
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,452
My wife invented

251
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:34,173
"Skipills", she mixed
vitamins with Alka-Seltzer

252
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,402
and pretended it was medicine.

253
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:37,290
I pay ten dollars a tube for those!

254
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:38,780
That's why I drive a Bentley.

255
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:41,252
Yeah, I haven't decided
what kind of new car to get.

256
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:42,772
Well, you'd better
decide soon.

257
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:45,883
'Cause I have a feeling your wife
will also be getting a "new model."

258
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:47,800
Yeah, she'll be "trading up."

259
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:49,552
And they're not
talking about cars.

260
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,760
Are you sure they're
not talking about cars?

261
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,332
Because those are car words.

262
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,561
Homer, we're all
second husbands.

263
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:57,813
As soon as our wives hit it big,

264
00:12:57,815 --> 00:13:00,542
they dumped the fat old guys
they were with and married us.

265
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:01,691
- Yes!
- Yes!

266
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:04,080
Marge won't dump me.

267
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:06,431
I'm the anchor that
keeps her weighed down.

268
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:08,780
Here's how it starts:

269
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,243
she gets a total makeover,

270
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:12,060
and she starts wearing
fancy new clothes.

271
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,310
Then she stops wanting to

272
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:14,663
tell you about her day.

273
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:15,470
Wha...?

274
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:17,803
Here's how you know
she's really about to go:

275
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:19,341
your wife seems happy

276
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:20,543
and full of life.

277
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:22,430
That will never happen!

278
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:25,333
Marge!

279
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:26,231
Marge!

280
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:30,893
A makeover!

281
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:31,861
Oh, my God!

282
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:34,070
The prophecy
is being fulfilled.

283
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:37,583
so,

284
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:39,060
tell me about your day.

285
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,383
Oh, you don't want
to hear about

286
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:42,090
my boring old day.

287
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:43,260
I do! I do!

288
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:46,302
Well, the first inspirational
speech of the day

289
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,723
was by the woman who
climbed Mount Everest and

290
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,450
got everyone else killed.

291
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:52,340
Hey, the networks
have different

292
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:53,531
channels in this city.

293
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:54,323
That's okay.

294
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:55,911
I don't care that
you don't care.

295
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,053
Go watch your thing.

296
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:02,000
Are you happy and
full of life?

297
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:03,933
I sure am!

298
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:21,521
Marge, now that
you're rich,

299
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:23,951
you really should get rid of that bag.

300
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:25,923
Really?

301
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:28,173
But I'm so used to my old one.

302
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:29,113
Old one?

303
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,400
They're convincing Marge to dump me!

304
00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:32,620
Oh, it's easy.

305
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,233
I get a new one
every two years.

306
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:34,992
From Italy!

307
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,773
You would love
a big black one.

308
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,812
Marge, get away
from them!

309
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:42,271
What's gotten
into you?

310
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:45,612
I'm going to the successful ladies room!

311
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,762
You guys got
to help me!

312
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:51,713
If Marge leaves,

313
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:54,191
I'll have nothing except my many friends

314
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:56,692
and half the fortune she is now making

315
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:58,513
and will continue to make.

316
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:00,502
Homer, I'm going to
let you in on a secret.

317
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,530
I am a first husband.

318
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:03,982
I used to look like this.

319
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:05,193
Huh?

320
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:07,183
What's your secret?

321
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:08,323
Oh, there's no secret.

322
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,262
Just hard work....

323
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:09,770
Uh-huh.

324
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:11,323
...exercise two hours a day...

325
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:11,940
Okay.

326
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,580
...keep up with
the latest fashions...

327
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:14,390
Fashions.

328
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:16,782
...and of course, cut out all
the fatty foods and alcohol.

329
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:17,792
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

330
00:15:17,798 --> 00:15:18,551
Got it.

331
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:20,381
I know just what it'll

332
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:22,321
take to hang on to Marge.

333
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:29,963
Mr. Simpson, let me outline

334
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:32,871
the gastric bypass surgery
procedure for you,

335
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:33,411
okay?

336
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:35,402
We put a band around your stomach

337
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:37,730
so that no solid food may enter.

338
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:40,071
You see, just like so.

339
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:43,511
It's a very, very serious operation.

340
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:46,393
You should only undergo
it as a last resort.

341
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:48,030
Please, Doc. I know I'm not

342
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:49,461
the greatest-looking guy in the world,

343
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,001
but I took care of my family,

344
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:52,471
and that used to be enough.

345
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,200
But not anymore.

346
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:55,360
Very well.

347
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,003
If you wish,
we can perform the

348
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:58,500
procedure in the office today.

349
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:01,010
And I know how I can knock myself out.

350
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,840
I'll look at your bill.

351
00:16:03,738 --> 00:16:05,440
I guess, considering all the training

352
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:07,492
you've received,
this is quite reasonable.

353
00:16:07,496 --> 00:16:09,380
I've never seen anything

354
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,623
so reasonable!

355
00:16:10,627 --> 00:16:13,540
It's the bargain of a lifetime!

356
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:14,073
And...

357
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:17,821
Dad, are you okay?

358
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:21,330
I see food on your plate
instead of blurring motions.

359
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:22,113
Kids,

360
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:24,953
your daddy underwent a special procedure

361
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:27,632
so he can be more
attractiveto your mother.

362
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:29,221
You had your hot dog plumped?

363
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:31,032
No, I had my stomach stapled!

364
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:54,813
All food tastes like barf now.

365
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:58,932
Homie, I'm back!

366
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:05,401
Welcome home, Marge.

367
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:08,483
You remembered I like romance!

368
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,280
A smart successful woman like

369
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,491
you deserves the very best.

370
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:15,231
You also remembered I like flattery!

371
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,341
Do you like guys who are...

372
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:19,093
attractive?

373
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:22,111
Homie, you look good!

374
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,940
All for you, baby.

375
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:25,891
Let me get a good
look at you!

376
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:28,761
Slow down, sexy beast.

377
00:17:28,768 --> 00:17:30,343
Why don't you take some time

378
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:31,692
to savor the front?

379
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:33,303
What are you hiding from me?

380
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:34,600
Is it chocolate?

381
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:36,203
Uh, it used to be.

382
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:39,892
Those buns are poppin' fresh!

383
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:41,971
Yeah, I'm gonna turn off the light now.

384
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:45,941
And I'll just fold
this old sweaty blanket

385
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,520
and put it in the closet.

386
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,633
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

387
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:54,611
Doctor, I'm embarrassed
to show my body to my wife,

388
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,760
and it's all because of your surgery!

389
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:59,011
You want me to unstaple your stomach?

390
00:17:59,545 --> 00:17:59,980
No,

391
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:01,522
I want you to give me

392
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,200
every other surgery you have

393
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:04,393
so I can look good!

394
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:06,920
And can you call it an
aortic valve replacement

395
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:08,193
so my insurance will cover it?

396
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:09,201
No problem.

397
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:11,032
Okay.

398
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:12,853
Count backwards from ten.

399
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,333
Fine, I admit it.

400
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:15,691
I'm drunk!

401
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,313
And so, to honor her success,

402
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:24,143
I bestow upon Marge Simpson

403
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,782
this $100 gift card

404
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:27,943
to Sweatpants Etcetera.

405
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,671
Did someone order a super stud?

406
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:35,453
My implants feel itchy.

407
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:37,610
Yes, I was out of silicone rubber.

408
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,560
so I used rolled-up socks.

409
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:43,833
He's a monster!

410
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,611
Pitchforks, everyone.

411
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:47,121
Monster!

412
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:48,391
Monster!

413
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:49,542
Monster!

414
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:51,003
Monster!

415
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:56,061
Cut his heart out!

416
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,182
Different from us!

417
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:04,643
Different from us!

418
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:05,263
Different...

419
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,100
Listen, Homer,

420
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:08,083
I got to be honest with you.

421
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:09,941
You'd better not make me cry,

422
00:19:09,946 --> 00:19:12,373
'cause I don't know where
my tear ducts are anymore.

423
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:14,460
I appreciate you trying
to become more

424
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:17,003
attractivefor me, but the truth is,

425
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:20,282
I'm way too successful for you now.

426
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:22,891
I'm getting me a trophy husband!

427
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:29,862
I don't want to live without you, Marge.

428
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:30,680
Okay.

429
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:32,780
No!

430
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:38,071
What...?

431
00:19:39,315 --> 00:19:41,200
Why do I look like me again?

432
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:44,833
The doctor called me about all
the crazy surgeries you wanted,

433
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:46,493
and I said no.

434
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:48,611
But I did have him unstaple your stomach

435
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:51,941
and turn you back into
the sweet man I love.

436
00:19:51,947 --> 00:19:53,233
Then it was all a dream?

437
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:55,783
I never became a hideous monster?

438
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:57,652
The only person who
thinks you're a monster

439
00:19:57,658 --> 00:19:59,672
is the one who had to
give you a sponge bath.

440
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:03,940
And Dad, I hope you
learned something from this.

441
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:05,190
I sure have.

442
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:07,401
Plastic surgery is a mistake,

443
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,372
because it hasn't been perfected
to where you look really good.

444
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,962
When it is, everyone should get it.

445
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:14,123
Amen.

446
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:17,813
Listen, Marge,

447
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,942
I've been wondering all these years,

448
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:23,081
why is it about me that
you find so irresistible?

449
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,331
Let's face it

450
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:25,692
you could do better.

451
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:27,421
Well, maybe I could.

452
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,430
But every time I look at you,

453
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:33,282
I see the same adorable
boyI fell in love with.

454
00:20:35,216 --> 00:20:38,483
Well, there's nothing
like a happy ending.

455
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:40,013
Holy heavens!

456
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:42,851
Is that a meteor heading for the Earth?

457
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:43,700
Maybe.

458
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,313
But tonight there's a benefit
for underpaid comic book

459
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:48,193
artists of the forties and fifties.

460
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,171
To the cash bar!
