1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,600
The South Pacific.

2
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,500
Thousand of islands lay scattered
across the world's most beautiful ocean.

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,400
But for centuries, man has traveled
these waters to meet in combat.

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,500
From brutal, tribal warfare to
the epic battles of World War II,

5
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,000
this is a place where rivals have
long traveled to settle old scores.

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,100
It is the perfect setting
for our biggest showdown yet.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,000
Welcome to the 20th season of "Survivor."

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,799
Over the past 10 years,

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:04,400
"Survivor" has traveled to some of the most
desolate, dangerous, and exotic places in the world.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,200
Over 300 people have tested themselves in the most
difficult, and groundbreaking show on television.

11
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,000
We have gathered 20 of
them to play one more time.

12
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Jeff: These are 10 of
your favorite Heroes.

13
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,100
Versus 10 of the most notorious Villains.

14
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,900
In my world, I've always tried
to show that good will win win.

15
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,999
I'm a Villain.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,699
I think Villains are smarter than Heroes

17
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,300
because they don't mind stabbing somebody
in the back to get where they want to get.

18
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,000
It's a fact.

19
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,800
It's a proven fact. Google it.

20
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,700
The Heroes are definitely people
I would rather play the game with.

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,800
The Villains are the people
I've always been against.

22
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,700
So this is perfect for me to be on the Heroes side and
battle it out against these punks I don't like anyway.

23
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,100
I've been labeled things like
"she devil in a blue bikini,"

24
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
"the Wicked Witch of the West."

25
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,000
"Man-eater Manthey."

26
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,500
That was my favorite one.

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,100
I'm back here to do what I
came to do the first time,

28
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,999
get to the end and make the money.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,600
So I'm definitely coming
back to redeem myself.

30
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,600
This time, I slay
everyone and trust no one.

31
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,100
This is my chance for
redemption redemption.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm not in the shape I was last time,

33
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,300
but I still think they can hang in
there as tough as any guy next to me.

34
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,500
But these people are smart,

35
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,099
they'll get rid of me right away.

36
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,500
It's the smartest thing
they can do, but they won't.

37
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,400
They never do.

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,400
I'm almost a decade older
than I was the first time.

39
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,300
So to me, it's a test
to see if I still got it.

40
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,600
Last time I was mean,
and this time I'm meaner.

41
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,600
You know, I'll lie.

42
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,099
I don't care.

43
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,300
But I'll make up a good lie.

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,399
People think they know me.

45
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,300
They really don't know me.

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,600
I'm a gangster in an Oprah suit.

47
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,299
But I'm not, like, a mean gangster.

48
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,500
I'm a nice gangster
with a smile, you know.

49
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,500
Jeff: It is still the ultimate challenge.

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,100
20 people forced to work together while
battling the elements and each other.

51
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,000
They must learn to adapt
or they'll be voted out.

52
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,700
In the end, only one will remain
to claim the million-dollar prize.

53
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,900
39 days, 20 people, one Survivor.

54
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,300
Sync www.ragbear.com Corrected dny238

55
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,000
Flying in the choppers, my
heart's beating a mile a minute.

56
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm sitting right next to Tom
and Cirie and all these people.

57
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,199
I know the game's going.

58
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
I'm finally back in the game.

59
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,100
Flying in on the helicopter,

60
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,599
you can feel something in the air.

61
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,700
There's an electricity.

62
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:17,000
There's a tension.

63
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,000
There's a level of excitement that is coursing
through everybody's veins, especially mine.

64
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,300
And to start off like that I think sets a
great tone for how the season is going to be.

65
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,500
Believe it or not, I'm a
little nervous going in.

66
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,799
I'm still in awe of who I'm here with.

67
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,400
I mean, for God's sake, Boston Rob.

68
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Parvati.

69
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,500
I mean, you know, I've got to get my mind
straight and not let them get me too star struck.

70
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,200
I'm out here playing a game with them now.

71
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,099
I'm nervous and I'm excited.

72
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,699
And, you know like before
you bungee jump or something,

73
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,399
you get that knot in your stomach,

74
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,800
and it, like, makes you
want to throw up, kind of.

75
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,700
That's how I feel right now.

76
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,200
I look over and see my fellow tribe-mates with
the blue buff on getting out of the copter.

77
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,899
It's pretty intense, you know.

78
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,799
My tribe, the Hero's train,

79
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,199
they're hard working,
tough guys, good people.

80
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,599
And I was like, this is it.

81
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,200
I can't wait to kick some ass out here.

82
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,800
Here we are, we're on
our nice little blue mat,

83
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,699
and then here come these Villains,

84
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,699
and you see... you
see Boston Rob,

85
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,000
and he's already got the walk
and the swagger and the attitude.

86
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,799
And then, you know, you
see Coach, and Jerri.

87
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,200
I mean, they really are Villains Villains.

88
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,400
I'm the original Villain of "Survivor"

89
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,300
and I have to tell you I feel like
mother Teresa right now with these people.

90
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,600
It's on.

91
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:18,700
Jeff: All right, let me officially welcome you
to "Survivor 20: Heroes vs. Villains."

92
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,400
Yeah, baby!

93
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,700
Jeff: 10 years, 20 seasons,

94
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,000
over 300 people have played "Survivor" the greatest
adventure game in the history of television.

95
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:41,400
Russell, how does it feel to be deemed
one of the 10 most notorious of all time?

96
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm still in awe that I'm here
with... with all these great players.

97
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,400
Finally, I can play the game with
somebody that respects the game.

98
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,400
Jeff: Boston Rob, you proud to be seen as
one of the 10 biggest Villains of all time?

99
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,300
I'm a Villain?

100
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,799
Well, it's all in perspective, I guess.

101
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,500
It's now you see it.

102
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Jeff: Rupert, a lot of
people have played this game.

103
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,000
Jeff: You're still, to this
day, one of the most popular.

104
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,500
It's... it's been an honor since
the first time that I got to play.

105
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,000
And now when I found out I'm on
the Heroes' side, I'll tell you,

106
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:27,300
I love the game, and being able
to have this chance, it's an honor.

107
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Jeff: Tom, another big Hero,
played a very solid game.

108
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,800
A lot of people like you.

109
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:37,600
They were happy you won, which isn't
always the case with some of our winners.

110
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,799
Stack up these two tribes.

111
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,100
You know, we kind of got maybe some positive energy
going just because we've been labeled the good guys,

112
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,900
but I also wouldn't assume that anybody
would stick with the game play that they had.

113
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,500
If it didn't work for them in a previous season
I would say they might do a 180 on this thing

114
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,900
and spin it around and I think
that could be from either tribe.

115
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,200
Jeff: Colby, in your season "Survivor: Australia"
our second season, going back 10 years ago,

116
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,799
you were so popular,

117
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,000
people were naming their children Colby.

118
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,800
Most of the ones I heard
about named their dogs Colby.

119
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,899
The kids, not bad. I'm take that.

120
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,200
What's the perspective
now, almost 10 years later?

121
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,000
It's taken my almost this long to really
get enough perspective to appreciate it,

122
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,500
and this is... this is my third
time back, and it is humbling.

123
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,100
It's the experience
and it's the adventure.

124
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,100
If you're not fired up at this point, riding
in on those birds, you don't have a pulse.

125
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,600
Jeff: JT, is it at all intimidating,
even within your own tribe,

126
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,800
when you look around at
who's surrounding you?

127
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,999
It's definitely intimidating.

128
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,500
I was watching these people
when I was in High School.

129
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,300
I was too young to apply for the show so I
couldn't do it and now I'm competing against them.

130
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,999
I'm still a rookie out here.

131
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,499
I'm probably the youngest one out here.

132
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,900
I feel like a young kid against
these people but I'm ready.

133
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,400
Jeff: Anybody out here feel
they're on the wrong tribe,

134
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,599
legitimately feel they're
on the wrong tribe.

135
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,799
Oh, yeah.

136
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
What did we do?

137
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,400
- Yeah, what did we do.
- What did we do that was so bad.

138
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,000
Jeff: So pretty much every Villain
thinks they should be on the Hero tribe.

139
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Except Jerri Manthey, the original
Black widow, still owning her title.

140
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,200
I even got a Black hat for this season.

141
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Is there a little symbolism with her
hat being Black and mine being white?

142
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,799
Jeff: Good versus evil?

143
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
It was not a mistake.

144
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,199
Jeff: Parvati, let's be clear,

145
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,400
while you did a great job and
were rewarded with $1 million,

146
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,100
you led one of the most notorious tribe
of women ever in the history of the game.

147
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,199
You betrayed people left and right.

148
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,700
You guys were responsible for
many, many blindsides. Great player?

149
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,099
Yes, that's why you're here. Hero?

150
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,700
No.

151
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,500
James, from your two cent,
Parvati, Hero or Villain?

152
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
Villain.

153
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,199
Jeff: James is bigger than me.

154
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,799
James is right.

155
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,700
I will fight him.

156
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:58,500
I'm not scared of him.

157
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,900
I don't care how big are you.

158
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:07,000
Jeff: Anybody here willing to say the sheer size
of James does make them take pause fair moment?

159
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,400
Yes.

160
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,500
Hello!

161
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Jeff: James, anybody on the
Villain tribe intimidate you?

162
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,399
It's the same story every time.

163
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,499
The talkers are the most dangerous.

164
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,800
The ones who strategize are
the best ones at the game.

165
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,100
They, bar none, have one most of
the series, most of the seasons.

166
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,800
So you've learned something
in your two times out here.

167
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
Believe it or not I have.

168
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,200
Jeff: Going back to when you were voted
out with two idols, one in each pocket.

169
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,500
Yes, thanks for reminding me.

170
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,100
Jeff: Boston Rob, how big a
factor is size versus scrap?

171
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,100
I think we have a huge
advantage over them.

172
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,500
Our women are clearly
stronger than their women.

173
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,300
- And our guys can hold the best of it... I'm
being serious. - You got the gloves, Jeff.

174
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,700
I don't see how they're going
to be able to keep up with us.

175
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,200
- I love you, Colby, but, man, you got the raw end of the stick.
- I'm so glad he's here.

176
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,500
I'm so glad Rob's back.

177
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,400
So, Rob, nobody on this tribe
of Heroes intimidates you?

178
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,099
I didn't say that, Jeff.

179
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,900
I just said I think we have the advantage.

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,500
And we're not going to be busy
dealing with all the egos over there.

181
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,000
Jeff: All right, well, we are going
to see how you match up right now.

182
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,799
It's time to get to your
first reward challenge.

183
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,200
Here's how it works... you
will square off two on two.

184
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,800
On my go, both pairs will
race out to dig up one bag.

185
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,400
Once you have the bag, you must
race back to your finish mat.

186
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,600
That's where it's going to get physical.

187
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,600
You have four people battling for one bag.

188
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,599
To score a point for your tribe,

189
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,900
you have to be touching the bag and
your finish mat at the same time.

190
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,900
First tribe to score
three points wins reward.

191
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,200
Want to know what you're playing for?

192
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,900
Yeah.

193
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,300
Jeff: In addition to the
challenges being physical,

194
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
the conditions are going
to be demanding as well.

195
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,000
Between the heat and the rain,

196
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,300
if you do not stay hydrated,
you will not last long.

197
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,600
Fire for the winner
of the first challenge.

198
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:16,000
Having fire 10 minutes into this game gives you a huge
advantage going into that first immunity challenge.

199
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,400
You win that challenge, you have momentum,
you could ride that all the way to the end.

200
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,999
I know it's worth playing for.

201
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,599
I'm going to give you a minute
to strategize on your match-ups

202
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,000
and then we'll get started.

203
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,199
All right, let's get
to our first challenge.

204
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,500
The first match-up is going to be
Stephenie and cirie for the Heroes,

205
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,000
taking on Parvati and
Danielle for the Villains.

206
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,899
This is the lane you're going to.

207
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,700
Right where I am.

208
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:44,000
Just come to me.

209
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,600
Survivors ready?

210
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,900
Go!

211
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,799
There's one bag in this sand.

212
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,900
You've got to find it, and you've
got to get back to your mat.

213
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:03,000
Danielle and cirie did this challenge
in their season "exile island."

214
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,300
They're now opponents
in the same challenge.

215
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Cirie has the bag.

216
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,200
Cirie and Parvati going at it.

217
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,499
It is physical quickly.

218
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,600
Danielle trying to steal it from cirie.

219
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,500
Stephenie and Danielle now have it.

220
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,700
Parvati now has the bag for the Villains.

221
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,500
Parvati takes it back from Stephenie,
but Stephenie takes Parvati down.

222
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,200
Cirie in on it.

223
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,099
Cirie now and Danielle.

224
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,199
Cirie is like a linebacker
in this challenge.

225
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,800
Parvati working Stephenie over.

226
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,500
Break her shoulder!

227
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,800
Come on, Danielle!

228
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,100
Come on!

229
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,300
Jeff: Danielle has the
bag for the Villains.

230
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,300
Villains score the first point.

231
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,500
Villains lead one-zip.

232
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,500
My shoulder.

233
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,600
Wait, wait, wait.

234
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,199
Medic.

235
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,399
No, no, no.

236
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,000
Hold on, hold on. Hold on.

237
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,400
I gotta relax.

238
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Her shoulder's out

239
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,600
what do you want me to do?

240
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,800
I'm a medical student, and when I
saw Stephenie dislocate her shoulder,

241
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,900
I knew she could leave the game
permanently over something like that.

242
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,900
Jeff: You want medical look at it?

243
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,700
What happens if medical looks at it?

244
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:38,499
Jeff: Stay here, stay

245
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,700
medical

246
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,500
Jeff: Her shoulder popped out.

247
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,500
You can just kneel down for me.

248
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,499
Hold it up.

249
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,900
Jeff: Hole it up? Like that?

250
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:57,700
Yup.

251
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,000
Jeff: Hang tight, okay.

252
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,400
Oh, okay.

253
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Jeff: Better?

254
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,499
The Villains are brutal.

255
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,700
They dislocated my shoulder
the first challenge.

256
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,499
I mean, really, like?

257
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,300
You're already on the Villain tribe
do you have to act like a total jerk?

258
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,700
It's okay now.

259
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,700
All right, we have played our first point
of the first challenge of "Survivor: 20"

260
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,099
and we have our first injury.

261
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,400
Stephenie's shoulder had to
be popped back into place.

262
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,999
Next round is one man, one woman.

263
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,200
It's Amanda and JT
taking on Randy and Jerri.

264
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,300
Lane two.

265
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,800
Survivors ready?

266
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:52,800
Go!

267
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,800
Come on, Jerri!

268
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,000
Jeff: Looking for that bag.

269
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:59,200
Then you have to get back with it.

270
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,100
Everybody putting one hand in the
sand and one eye on their opponent.

271
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,699
Jerri's got it.

272
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,000
Now it's a battle to get it up.

273
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:12,500
Jerri found it, but she didn't get it up.

274
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,099
Amanda trying to pull Jerri out of there.

275
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,000
Get right on her, Mandy!

276
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,000
Jeff: Nobody has the bag.

277
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,499
JT has Randy in some kind of a hold.

278
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,900
That's some country right there.

279
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,200
All that work and the bag
is still stuck in the sand.

280
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,200
Jerri, behind you!

281
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,600
Jeff: JT trying to get it.

282
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,400
JT has the bag.

283
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,799
It's one on one.

284
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,200
JT eludes Randy.

285
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
We are tied, 1-1.

286
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:03,900
Here we go, next round, it is Colby
and Tom taking on Coach and Russell.

287
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,099
You're coming to lane nine, the last lane.

288
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,499
Survivors ready?

289
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,799
You guys got it, you got it.

290
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Jeff: Go!

291
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,900
Russell digging for the Villains,
Tom and Colby digging for the Heroes.

292
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Coach hanging back just watching watching.

293
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,100
Not going to let anybody get
a free sprint to the finish.

294
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,999
A big match-up, four strong guys.

295
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Four fit guys.

296
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,800
This will not be an easy
path to get back to your mat.

297
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,000
Whoever gets this point
is going to earn it.

298
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,200
Russell has the bag for the Villains.

299
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,699
Tries to toss it to Coach.

300
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,400
Doesn't work.

301
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:57,700
Colby now has a hand
on it. This is full on.

302
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Coach takes Colby over.

303
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,399
Colby's trying to push Coach off.

304
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,600
Coach not having it.

305
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,600
Goat your feet, Colby!

306
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,599
Jeff: Colby inching forward.

307
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,099
Drag him up!

308
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Jeff: Russell now
trying to get free of Tom.

309
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,200
Colby ready to make a move.

310
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,600
Colby now dragging Coach.

311
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,300
Russell really being tough on Tom.

312
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,800
Play fair down there!

313
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Play fair!

314
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,300
Colby eyeing that mat.

315
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,300
He's just got to make sure Coach
doesn't drag him to the other mat.

316
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,000
Coach now dragging Colby.

317
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Here comes Tom and Russell.

318
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,200
Coach scores!

319
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,199
Colby getting owned by Coach.

320
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,599
Oh, my gosh, dude.

321
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,700
I can only imagine what Colby's thinking.

322
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,450
He's got to be like I may as
well just become a woman because

323
00:22:14,451 --> 00:22:18,100
there's no point on trying to
maintain my masculinity now.

324
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,700
Jeff: Villains now lead 2-1.

325
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,899
Next round.

326
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,399
We are back to women taking on women.

327
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,400
It is Sugar and Candice for the
Heroes taking on Sandra and Courtney.

328
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,399
Lane five.

329
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,699
Survivors ready?

330
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,500
Go.

331
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,100
Heroes need to score.

332
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,900
All four women are digging
and watching at the same time.

333
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,900
Trying to find the bag while making sure somebody
else doesn't find the bag while you're looking.

334
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,099
Courtney had it.

335
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,300
Candice is holding on to it.

336
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,700
Courtney fighting in there.

337
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:08,533
The smallest woman in this game.

338
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:11,299
Candice now trying to get up.

339
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,900
Hold on!

340
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,200
Jeff: Candice standing up by
Courtney pulling her back down.

341
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,599
Come on, Courtney!

342
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,000
Hold on!

343
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,400
Jeff: Candice dragging
Courtney toward her mat.

344
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,800
Sandra has Sugar.

345
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,100
Sandra now getting involved.

346
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,200
Sugar trying to take
that bag from Candace.

347
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,700
There you go!

348
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,200
Sugar has it.

349
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,799
The bag is now free!

350
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,199
The bag is totally free.

351
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,100
Sandra undid Sugar's top.

352
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,899
That bag is free.

353
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,500
And nobody can get free to get it.

354
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,400
Sugar lets go of here top,
Sugar takes the bag.

355
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,600
Sugar gives up vanity
and scores for the Heroes.

356
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,400
Initially I thought maybe Sandra
shouldn't be on the Villain's tribe.

357
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,300
Not any more.

358
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:21,900
Sandra earned her title as Villain
to me with the bra incident and Sugar.

359
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:28,000
Jeff: We are tied, Heroes two,
Villains two, playing to three.

360
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,399
This is it.

361
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:35,700
For the Heroes, James and Rupert
taking on Tyson and Boston Rob.

362
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,299
This should be a doozy.

363
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,200
Come to me right here.

364
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,299
Lane 8.

365
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,000
Survivors ready?

366
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,600
Go!

367
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,200
James digging.

368
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,299
Tyson digging.

369
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,899
Rupert digging.

370
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,200
Boston Rob is just
sticking back and watching.

371
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,200
Tyson has it for the Villains,

372
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:14,200
but James ties him up before he can
even get it out of the sand. Sand.

373
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,600
Rob now going for the bag.

374
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:17,700
Stay back.

375
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,900
Rob and James going at it.

376
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,999
Rupert ties up Boston Rob.

377
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It's James and Rob.

378
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,700
Rob tried to take James, can't do it.

379
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,000
James scores, Heroes win reward!

380
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,700
When I came out of the final heat, my toe
instead of going up and down was a "j."

381
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,799
It's broke.

382
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,299
I can feel it.

383
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,100
Not that one, this one.

384
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,100
That's stuck in now.

385
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,400
Are you in pain there?

386
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,500
That's bad.

387
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,700
My toe is broke, and I
felt it cracking inside.

388
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,600
But I'm not getting put out of this
game over a damn toe first damn day.

389
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,099
Jeff: So let's do an injury count.

390
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,300
Rupert has a broken toe,

391
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:30,299
Stephenie has a dislocated
and relocated shoulder.

392
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,999
Hopefully, it was worth it.

393
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,800
Big victory for the Heroes. Fire.

394
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And a map to your new home.

395
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,200
Villains.

396
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
You are definitely living up to your name.

397
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,500
Grab your stuff, head to your
camp, and start working on shelter.

398
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,999
The Villains lost.

399
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,299
You think that really bothers me?

400
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,399
Losing?

401
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,199
Because I'm used to losing.

402
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
With a bunch of dummies.

403
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:57,800
But the difference is, this
ain't a bunch of dummies.

404
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,800
We will win.

405
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,600
And I'm looking forward to sending the Heroes to
tribal council and letting them do their Hero thing.

406
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Look what we've got here.

407
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:21,473
is there a flint in here or not?
There is...

408
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:23,573
What the...?

409
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
That's it.

410
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,899
You have to make your own.

411
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,799
I can't believe I'm doing this again.

412
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,599
It's just starting to sink in.

413
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
I believe I'm going to have to
stay on my toes with these fellas.

414
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,200
I'm ready for it.

415
00:27:35,201 --> 00:27:37,200
I'm ready for the challenge.

416
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,600
We should live under this
tree because it's drive.

417
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,499
That's what I'm thinking.

418
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,998
This is, like the biggest
tree right here, right?

419
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,800
I am.

420
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:48,200
Really bad.

421
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,100
They like that dragon blood.

422
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,900
I got way more to prove right
here than I did the last time.

423
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,800
If I could do it here, if
I can take it all the way,

424
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,100
if I can whoop these all-stars,
doesn't that mean I'm the best ever?

425
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,300
Clash of the titans, you
think it's Rob and who?

426
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Who's gonna fight him for dominance?

427
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,499
I'm going to play
similar to the same game.

428
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,100
I'm going to use the mind game.

429
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,599
They better give it their
all and play the game.

430
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,200
Because I'm taking this crap serious.

431
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,500
That's why I'm here.

432
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:31,759
I have to work my magic on... on the
Villain side which is going to be tough.

433
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,599
I'm going to be straight up with you.

434
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,500
Yeah.

435
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:38,499
I want to go to the final two.

436
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,799
Yeah, so do I.

437
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,199
And I ain't gonna
say that to anybody else.

438
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,600
I'm an aggressive player.

439
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:47,900
I'm here to win, and, you know,
I want to make smart alliances.

440
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,900
The thing is if we can trust each other
and we can do this... which I trust you.

441
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,700
I trust you, too.

442
00:28:52,701 --> 00:28:54,799
You have to trust me. You have to.

443
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,600
No matter what.

444
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,700
- Because that's the whole name of the game.
- I know, I know.

445
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,799
And this is where it
happens the first day.

446
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,100
This is when it happens.

447
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,400
With Russell, he's a great
person to play this game with.

448
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,399
He knows exactly what he's doing.

449
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,700
I'm going with my gut and I
think I should stick with him

450
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,700
until it gets to a point where
I feel like he'd turn on me.

451
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,499
I will stab people in the back.

452
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,099
I know.

453
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,000
I'll do whatever it
takes to get to the top,

454
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,200
- but what I'm telling you is I want to get to the top with you.
- Yeah.

455
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,000
We are going to be better of a pair
than you can even possibly imagine.

456
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,300
I agree.

457
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,300
This is what I want, I want me and
you to go to the top two, period.

458
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,300
That's what I really, really want.

459
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,100
I'm down with that.

460
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,700
And I can swing it.

461
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,600
I can swing it because if we get
to the merge, we can swing it.

462
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,400
That's where you could really help me.

463
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,900
I just always get
nervous in the beginning.

464
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:49,900
Don't. You just trust me.

465
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,300
I clearly know that Russell is running around talking
to everyone and telling everyone the same thing,

466
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,300
but we can either work with
each other or against each other,

467
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,299
and I do not want to work against him.

468
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,100
Are you kidding.

469
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:01,399
He's just an incredible force.

470
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,299
I want you to trust me.

471
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,199
Do you trust me?

472
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,900
I trust you.

473
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,699
Do you trust me?

474
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,300
I do.

475
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:10,000
I want to trust you.

476
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,500
Do I have any options?

477
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:13,199
That's not the point.

478
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,900
If... if you did,
'cause one day you will.

479
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,400
If you merge you will have options.

480
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,900
With Russell, I definitely feel
like I am making a deal with the devil

481
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,600
but I want the devil on my side.

482
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,200
These are all-stars,
but you know what?

483
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:32,000
Like Michael Jordan is in basketball,
like Michael Phelps is in swimming.

484
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,500
There's always somebody
that's above their sport,

485
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,700
and I'm the best player
that ever played this game.

486
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,600
Now guess what?

487
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:43,400
I get to prove it.

488
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,699
Sweet!

489
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,400
All right!

490
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,299
We've got a net.

491
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,999
Wow! We have a net?

492
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah!

493
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,599
Well, here we are, guys.

494
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,400
Here we are.

495
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,599
Heroes?

496
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,800
We're Heroes! Heroes!

497
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,899
Return, revenge, and redemption.

498
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,299
Well... all right.

499
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,900
Shall we take a celebratory dip?

500
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
- Yes.
- I think so.

501
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,400
It takes a little bit to get back into
into the rhythm of "Survivor" and go,

502
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,299
"all right, I remember this.

503
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,999
It's going to be miserable."

504
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,700
A little chillier than
you'd think, isn't it?

505
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,000
But you just don't remember what it feels like
to be stranded and know you're just at the tip

506
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,900
you're at the beginning of a
long journey if you're lucky.

507
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,600
It's got to be the best first day
challenge I've ever seen in any "Survivor."

508
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,200
Sugar got topless.

509
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Stephenie dislocated her
shoulder and put it back in

510
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,800
and Rupert broke one toe in three places.

511
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,700
You know, the challenge, I think
our team showed its strength.

512
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,200
Unfortunately, I didn't. The
challenge was rough for me.

513
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,300
I don't like losing at anything,
and I got beat by Coach.

514
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,300
So I'm so rusty on the game,
but I'm having a good time.

515
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,499
We're making our first group decision.

516
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,800
Oh, goody!

517
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:18,100
I mean, we can just build something
really quick right now now.

518
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,000
The two oldest
men, can we have...

519
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,300
the two older men, could you
guys keep your opinions to yourself?

520
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,400
We're all kids, and
we don't know anything.

521
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,400
So... what do
you guys think?

522
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,600
Is it better to have more bugs in the
jungle or what it be too cold out here

523
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,800
or can we just build a
shelter to block the wind?

524
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,999
I say here.

525
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,299
I say front.

526
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,399
All for here?

527
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,200
Fire in the rain.

528
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,100
All right.

529
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,000
Wow, this is light.

530
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,899
I love my tribe.

531
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,099
We have a good aura. We have good energy.

532
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,299
You know, we all have a good work ethic.

533
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,599
We could start putting it up, I guess.

534
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,199
Yeah.

535
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,400
We know what needs to be done.

536
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:23,300
We work together.

537
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,300
And I feel really lucky to be on the
Heroes' side and to have the team I have.

538
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,000
I think we should use the big
ones maybe for the top, higher up.

539
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,600
Everything was going right.

540
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:36,199
We have good karma right now.

541
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,400
It's great.

542
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,299
A post to split the coconut husk on.

543
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:55,400
We need a short, pointy... I
thought I heard some clucking,

544
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,400
and I went around and looked in the bush,

545
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,800
and I see some movement
out of the corner of my eye,

546
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:03,300
and here comes a roster,
three hens, walking right out.

547
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,999
Guys, look at this.

548
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,099
Three chickens right here.

549
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,299
Chicken?

550
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,000
Stay right here, Tom.

551
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm going to go around the other side.

552
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:12,599
Here's another one right here.

553
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,099
We have four chickens.

554
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,900
Here's another one.

555
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:19,000
We've got three people so anybody
that can catch a chicken come this way.

556
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,500
Go around the back, guys,
and draw them out towards us.

557
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,100
- Do you have the net?
- Grab that fishnet.

558
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,100
It will be great.

559
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:27,500
Bring it up.

560
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,800
Everybody who's free
should just surround them.

561
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,400
How about if we have four of us go, like,
one, two, and then just throw it out like this.

562
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,400
- You ready?
- Don't overthrow.

563
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,000
Yeah, baby!

564
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,400
It's getting away!

565
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,300
You gotta, man! Chicken!

566
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,100
Chicken dinner!

567
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,500
Every last one of them, wow.

568
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,400
I have seen my share of chickens,
and I've caught my share of them,

569
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,200
but never in the wild, and to actually, um,
catch them successfully, all four of them.

570
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,200
That's incredible.

571
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:21,399
Oh, my God. I don't believe it!

572
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,200
I know.

573
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:23,699
Oh, my God, you guys.

574
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,799
Nice work.

575
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,899
They are cute, aren't they?

576
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,400
Watching these guys
working together, I'm ecstatic.

577
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,800
Coming back into "Survivor" I know the
first five days are the hardest time.

578
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,699
I haven't hit that wall yet.

579
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,399
Maybe in our tribe we
won't. We found chicken.

580
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,699
We're going to be out of the elements.

581
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,700
It's going to be a Hero.

582
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,599
What did you guys think
of the challenge today?

583
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,400
Let's review.

584
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:05,000
We're glad that Rupert stubbed his toe.

585
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,500
One part of me wants
to have sympathy for him,

586
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,900
but another side of me I almost
relished the fact that they got injured.

587
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,400
I was like, good for them.

588
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,900
I definitely had mixed
emotions about losing the challenge

589
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,199
because whereas personally
it made a statement.

590
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,599
The tribe lost.

591
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,999
I had him the whole time.

592
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
There was not one point in that challenge where
I thought he was going to get the better of me.

593
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,000
You...

594
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,100
well, he almost took off running
and you had to tackle him down.

595
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,199
We were like, "no!"

596
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,900
everybody thought Colby was
going to have his way with me.

597
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,700
The tribe was taking about it
long after I'd forgotten about it

598
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,100
how I'd gone out there and basically frog marched
Colby to the mat at the end so it was very fulfilling.

599
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,600
At the end I moved him,
moved him, moved him, mat.

600
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Bam.

601
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,200
I enjoyed every second of that.

602
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,499
Coach, what a surprise.

603
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,800
Honestly, I'm very surprised by Coach.

604
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,400
There's just something about him,
and I don't know what it is yet.

605
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,400
I'm definitely going to make
it a point to get to know Coach.

606
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,300
I know I'm stealing Coach's mantra here
but I'm going into this like a warrior.

607
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,199
That's really what you have to do.

608
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,400
How did you know that was my mantra?

609
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
I heard stuff about you.

610
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,400
One thing that appeals to me about
Jerri is that she's a different kind of girl,

611
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,699
and that interests me because
I'm a different kind of guy.

612
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,099
Randy, are you chuckling over there?

613
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,399
No, I'm laughing at Colby's face?

614
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,900
He actually looked a little scared.

615
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,700
You know what, Coach, I think that,
uh, you don't step away from love.

616
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,100
If it's hitting you in the face,

617
00:38:01,101 --> 00:38:02,999
you grab a hold of it.

618
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,699
You never know, man.

619
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,600
You never know.

620
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:07,799
I would never get
in the way of true love.

621
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,000
Go for it, dude!

622
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,200
- Go for it.
- I agree.

623
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,300
- You are talking about Parvati?
- No, I'm talking about Jerri.

624
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,000
I have never in a million years would
think about coming out on "Survivor"

625
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,199
and actually being interested in somebody.

626
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,199
But Jerri and, I we
had a little connection.

627
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,400
How's it going, Coach?

628
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,300
- You might find love here.
- What?

629
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,699
Are you guys playing cupid?

630
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,099
Yes.

631
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,900
You and the dragon slayer.

632
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,400
Oh, I see romance blooming
between Jerri and Coach.

633
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,300
And Jerri's in total denial, but
she totally flirts, and she's,

634
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,400
I think, in spite of herself, a little
bit in love with the dragon slayer.

635
00:38:49,513 --> 00:38:53,100
What's the problem?

636
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,000
You know what, love finds you
sometimes and you don't even know it.

637
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,100
Well, you do know that, just by cuddling
together one night we created a whole little...

638
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,400
I know.

639
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,300
A controversial buzz that could
potentially not be... I don't know.

640
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,799
I just think we carry on our business.

641
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,600
I think if we just go about our day

642
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,800
and we don't have too many talks like this
unless we're walking down the beach that way.

643
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,500
In, right.

644
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,600
It sucks, because,
obviously, I want to talk to you.

645
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,399
I know, I know.

646
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,800
The girls were joking about it.

647
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:26,400
They were like, "oh, the Black widow and
the dragon slayer. What a combination."

648
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,299
Hey, you never know.

649
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,100
We might pair up and run this game.

650
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,500
But we need to be careful, Jerri and I, of having
the appearance of being in an unbreakable alliance.

651
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,500
Would you let me know
if I worry about something.

652
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,000
Don't worry about anything.

653
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
- OK?
- OK.

654
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,299
I hate feeling alone out here.

655
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,499
You're not alone.

656
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,199
It's the worst feeling in the world.

657
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,199
You shouldn't be worried.

658
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,700
You're with the dragon slayer, man.

659
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:51,000
Don't you worry about that.

660
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,299
We've got a good group.

661
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,299
That's what I'm saying.

662
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,599
Here's the thing, this is
between me and you right here,

663
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,200
it's got to be.

664
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:14,399
I'm willing to make an
alliance right now with you.

665
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Dude.

666
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,100
We should never lose, man.

667
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,900
I don't want flower power to be
running over this thing like it was.

668
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,999
Hey, I went through it.

669
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,900
I know, man.

670
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:27,200
It was terrible.

671
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,200
James and I, you know, we're
buddies right off the the bat.

672
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,099
We both worked hard.

673
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,100
He's eye guy's-guy.

674
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:33,599
We can talk straight up.

675
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,400
Everything he tells me I believe it.

676
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,700
Could I beat James if it was
me and him in the final two?

677
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,499
No, but I don't see us in the final two.

678
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:48,100
We stay strong, dude.

679
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,000
That's the deal.

680
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:49,999
For real.

681
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,300
I'm going to form an
alliance with everyone I can.

682
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:55,300
My strategy is to keep
everyone on my side, man.

683
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,200
Here's the thing, Candice,

684
00:40:59,201 --> 00:41:03,400
keep your eye out for JT and James.

685
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,399
I know that James and
Amanda played together.

686
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,900
And you know Tom and Stephenie.

687
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,600
Do you know any of these players?

688
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,000
I don't know them, but I know that there's
people that, you know, are already aligned.

689
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,499
I know that you know that.

690
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,400
That's my concern.

691
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:22,999
The first couple of days
are always the worst out here.

692
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,299
Because you don't have everything settled.

693
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,999
You don't know everybody.

694
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,599
And so it's always kind of awkward.

695
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,500
What do you know about cirie?

696
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,999
You mean, like, how
she played the game?

697
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I don't know anything about her.

698
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:37,399
I don't know her.

699
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,999
She and Amanda were
on the same season, right?

700
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,200
Yeah.

701
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,100
Are they friends?

702
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,699
Going into the game again,

703
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,699
I'm worried about people
who have a history together.

704
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,700
They've played on seasons before together.

705
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,700
And I don't really have anyone that I have
a solid history with going into the game.

706
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,899
Well, didn't take long
for the game to start.

707
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,500
Yeah.

708
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,600
We're back again.

709
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:03,999
I know.

710
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,399
What do you think?

711
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,199
I don't know yet.

712
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,000
What do you think?

713
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:08,899
I don't know, I'm trying...

714
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,000
trying to assess the situation.

715
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:13,299
Year, exactly.

716
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,099
We can't be off alone like this, though.

717
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,899
Target, target, target,

718
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,700
Micronesia target.

719
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,700
James, myself, and cirie, you know,
we played this game together before.

720
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,700
I played this twice with
James in China and Micronesia.

721
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,900
I played it once with cirie.

722
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,500
And cirie and I went to the end together.

723
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:34,000
We were in an alliance the whole time so
we're going to have to watch our distance

724
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,300
because if people think we're too chummy
it could definitely play against us.

725
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,577
So how you doing, my friend?

726
00:42:43,225 --> 00:42:45,127
I'm glad we're on the same tribe.

727
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,700
Yeah, that's great.

728
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
It's like deja vu.

729
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,900
Hopefully we can run this thing where
we avoid tribal council in the beginning.

730
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,200
Yeah, but I'm trying to think
who I want to get involved with here.

731
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,500
- Right.
- If I first...

732
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,799
My closest ally is Stephenie.

733
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,200
We played well together
in our season in Palau.

734
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:14,400
And I was thrilled to see her back
here on this beach in my tribe.

735
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,000
I think Colby, JT, and
you would be my choice,

736
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,900
but like you said we
don't know what's going on.

737
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,400
I'm going to try to work with Stephenie as far as
we can but she might not be my smartest end player.

738
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,299
If I were to get that far in
the game and were to face a jury,

739
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,599
I want somebody else who won the
million dollars to sit next to me.

740
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,299
So, you know, seeing you right away.

741
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,500
I will, you know, you want to make
some kind of an oath, whatever.

742
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,858
- You and I need each other.
- I know.

743
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:45,800
- Because we both won the money.
- They have to choose one of us.

744
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,200
If either one of us, no
matter how good a game we play,

745
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,800
- goes up against someone
who didn't win... - we lose.

746
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,200
- It's a good plan.
- All right.

747
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,739
People are expecting me to be that guy they
saw on "Tocantins" the guy who stuck by his word

748
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,780
and did everything he had to do.

749
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,170
But this game is completely different.

750
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,510
Everybody already seen me play.

751
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:07,500
You're my guy till the end.

752
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,960
You got me.

753
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,609
I need you, and you need me.

754
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,799
We need each other.

755
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,290
Right.

756
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,460
To win this game of "Survivor" you
have to have a dark side somewhere.

757
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:22,370
You have to be willing to sacrifice some of
your integrity to make it far in this game,

758
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,390
and I'm not looking to save my Hero name.

759
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,370
I'm here to do what I have
to do to win this game.

760
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,790
So it's going to be a whole
different ballgame for me.

761
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,060
Sandra, do you know how to do this?

762
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:47,750
It's not working.

763
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,750
I think I'm not going to do this anymore.

764
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,950
We got 10 people here.

765
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,240
They don't want to do anything for
more than, like, 10 minutes at a time.

766
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:58,870
I know.

767
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,700
But nobody has any energy
because we don't have any water.

768
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:05,220
Everybody's going to be dead for
this challenge if we don't get water.

769
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,569
Yeah.

770
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,620
We have to build a fire.

771
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,660
It's been six years since I've played
the game, and a lot has changed.

772
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,110
Like there's nobody here
that wants to do anything.

773
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,030
They don't want to build a shelter.

774
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:21,230
They don't want to try
to get a fire going.

775
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,990
It's not that they don't know what to do.

776
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,780
They've all played "Survivor" before.

777
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,650
Sandra's won the game.

778
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,140
So they know what they're doing,

779
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,700
and it's, like, ripping at my every fiber.

780
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:37,670
My wife told me have
patience. Amber, I'm trying.

781
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,960
You're... you're just going
to carve a gouge in there...

782
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,380
a little gouge.

783
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,820
And then I'm going to take another
piece of bamboo and rub it like this.

784
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,870
You know, nobody's going to
get voted out for not making fire,

785
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:54,190
and nobody's going to get
to stay trying to make fire.

786
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,670
So why don't we blow it off?

787
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:56,600
Do you think?

788
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,450
You're just going to aware yourself out.

789
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,340
I feel like I want to at least try it.

790
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,120
You know, I played this game before,

791
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:09,950
and if you don't have flint
and steel, you can't make fire.

792
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,130
Not by rubbing two sticks together.

793
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,240
This game lasts 39 days.

794
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:16,820
I think we'll get fire
by the end of 39 days.

795
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,230
Slow, short strokes at first.

796
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,370
Starting to get some smoke.

797
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,250
Oh, my God!

798
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,280
Keep going.

799
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,900
Real fast now.

800
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:40,730
Here we go!

801
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,550
Three, two, one. Do it.

802
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,269
It's happening.

803
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,350
This is happening.

804
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,190
Rob, you're the man
counsel down here, too.

805
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,610
None of us is going to do anything.

806
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,640
You're in charge.

807
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,110
Unbelievable!

808
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:27,010
I'm still the same guy I was
the first time I played this game.

809
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,340
That competitiveness, that
cut throatness, that's me.

810
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:31,950
At the same time,

811
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,989
a lot has happened with me
personally in my life in the six years

812
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,470
since I've played this game last.

813
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,379
You know, I got married. I had a kid.

814
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,420
I'm learning compromise and patience.

815
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,710
But look at these people. You know.

816
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:49,150
Not the brightest bulbs, and I'm here trying
to make the most of it, trying to make it work.

817
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:50,340
We've got fire!

818
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,650
Beautiful.

819
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,490
I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it.

820
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,510
I know, man.

821
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:04,420
I gotta tell you, I'm a little in awe
of Rob, and I'm not like that with people.

822
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,140
You know, he's played it twice.

823
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,310
He's intuitive and
ingenious and very smart.

824
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,189
So that's great.

825
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,620
He's a great guy to have on the tribe.

826
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,569
You are the man.

827
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:17,209
And when you're talk I'm like...
I'm literally hanging on every word.

828
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,040
I appreciate it, I do.

829
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,330
I'm like hanging on every word.

830
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:26,480
We made fire, and now Coach is going off
with Boston Rob like he's a Hero or something.

831
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,380
I'm romancing on my
idol, what can I say?

832
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,460
Rob, he thinks he's
the boss of the camp.

833
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:32,900
He thinks he's in control.

834
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,010
But this is my mountain and
I'm still the king of the hill.

835
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,540
"Survivor "is my palace.

836
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,480
And I'm still the thing
unless I'm dethroned.

837
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,500
You know what?

838
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,170
That ain't going to happen.

839
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:54,029
Jeff: Coming up on this special two-hour
season premiere of "Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains... "

840
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,170
we have to divide them.

841
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:56,170
Jeff: Survivors ready?

842
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:56,889
Go!

843
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,070
Come on, Heroes!

844
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:04,790
Jeff: Coach is leading the tribe of Villain
using all of that life experience in a kayak.

845
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,950
It's only a matter of time before
that tribe self-destructs self-destructs.

846
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:30,850
Being able to get out in the ocean,
that's where I feel most comfortable.

847
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,930
But my toe is broken at least two places.

848
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,510
And I haven't caught a darn fish yet.

849
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:39,460
It would be better off for me right now,

850
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,900
especially with my darn
toe, to be a worker bee.

851
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:48,020
I'm going to start a
fire. You can do this.

852
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:50,080
Just start the damn fire.

853
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,770
Gosh darn it.

854
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,479
Come on. Come on. Come on.

855
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,910
You can do this.

856
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,100
Rupert the fire maker.

857
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,400
He shaved half the
magnesium off the flint.

858
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,160
You know, still couldn't get the fire.

859
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:16,799
You don't want to say anything.

860
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,160
You just sit there and watch
because his ego is so humongous.

861
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,660
What can you say?

862
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,090
Smell smoke, right?

863
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:27,780
Yeah, I tell you why it can't root

864
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:29,689
You want to go ahead.

865
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:38,270
But I've been sitting here for a while, and
I... I've had some hellacious piles of magnesium.

866
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:40,689
It's okay.

867
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:41,679
It's a state of mind.

868
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,130
Making fires is as much a
state of mind as anything.

869
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,580
Got to make fire, man.

870
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,180
Wow, that's looking...
now we're talking.

871
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:10,410
The only thing that I'm worried
about is my darn broken toe.

872
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:17,070
If it starts coming up more and more about how much pain
I'm really in and what I really can bring to this tribe,

873
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:22,020
because I haven't done a
whole lot yet, that worries me.

874
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,190
Good for you guys.

875
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,080
You just scoot up.

876
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:42,170
Tyson and I decided we wanted to try to climb
this coconut tree to get the palm fronds off.

877
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,630
Jerri, give me the knife.

878
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,399
Is it too dangerous?

879
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,999
It's pretty precarious with the wind.

880
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,220
The wind is blowing up there.

881
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:53,140
Amber's not gonna like this

882
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:53,760
get down.

883
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,909
She's like, "why did
you let him do that?"

884
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:57,920
he's a father.

885
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,800
I was told not to do anything stupid.

886
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,960
You go ahead and try.

887
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,700
I could probably go up there and get them
but why would I risk falling and getting hurt?

888
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,280
Man it's higher than it looks.

889
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,169
But I know somebody who is so full
of themselves they'll have to do it

890
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:17,180
because they're the greatest and the best
and every day out here they get stronger.

891
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:24,830
He wants to be a Hero, but he's really
a Villain, so we'll see how this goes.

892
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,140
I say don't do it.

893
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,849
Get your ass up that tree, will you!

894
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,600
Boston Rob and I do
have a good time together.

895
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,140
I like talking to him because
he's sharp and I like that.

896
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:36,359
And he's going to challenge me,

897
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,650
and I think I'm going to challenge him.

898
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,380
I think I need somebody
who is able to sharpen me.

899
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,250
Iron sharpens iron.

900
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,580
Come on you can do it

901
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,620
at least he'll land in the water.

902
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,410
You want to make a bet? >> what.

903
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,410
If he makes it or not.

904
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:50,730
I'll bet you a dollar.

905
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:53,990
The person I think I'm
most like is Boston Rob.

906
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,440
Seeing Rob here it reminds me
of when he played the first time.

907
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,340
I loved him.

908
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,290
All right.

909
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:03,590
All right, a dollar that
he won't make it to the top?

910
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,240
And you're saying a dollar he will do it?

911
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:06,320
He's going to do it.

912
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,730
That's someone I can see myself aligning
with until it's time to cut his throat.

913
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,050
Sometimes you got to go retrieve
dragon eggs in the tree.

914
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,670
I bet on you!

915
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,270
What?

916
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,370
I bet that you would make it.

917
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,680
I bet that you'd fall in the water.

918
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,250
Oh, he's giving up!

919
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:28,750
Oh, no!

920
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:30,120
He's giving up!

921
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,250
You're not a warrior!

922
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,240
Get up there.

923
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,290
Get back down, get back down.

924
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:35,910
Man!

925
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,890
Sandra, winner, from
Boston Bob the loser.

926
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:44,280
Boston Bob.

927
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:48,059
So I bowed out, swallowed my pride.

928
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:48,900
Not worth it.

929
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:50,480
Tucked my tail, went back down.

930
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,900
Man, you cost me.

931
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,180
I won.

932
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,760
I made a bet and I lost.

933
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,639
I could have probably made it
up to where it starts getting...

934
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,040
should-a, would-a
could-a didn't.

935
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,130
But it's not worth it.

936
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,510
Could I make it up there? Yes?

937
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,540
But if I fall up...
up... why risk that.

938
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,900
From the Hero to the zero.

939
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:12,250
From the Villain to the never was.

940
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,180
This game, it's a reflection of
your life and you don't even realize it.

941
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:43,350
I guess in life I always need a protector of some
sort, and especially in the game of "Survivor."

942
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:48,960
So now I'm starting to realize that I've
got these sexy young men on my tribe.

943
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,960
What's going on over there, Colby?

944
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:59,050
It was night two.

945
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,920
People are starting to fade off
and get some much-needed rest.

946
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:05,209
That's what we have to have
to stay strong and compete.

947
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,330
Is that a satellite or shooting star?

948
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,320
Sugar, she just
starts chatting up again,

949
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,300
and not whispering but chatting up loud.

950
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:13,210
You guys are all spooning.

951
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,440
I don't want to spoon.

952
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,820
And you can start to feel and
see everyone kind of wrestle weak.

953
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:21,990
I couldn't even roll over

954
00:55:21,991 --> 00:55:27,290
without her rolling over or putting her arms around me or
them when I would just lay there still like I was in a coffin,

955
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,090
she'd grab my hands and put them on her.

956
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,700
I'm just not interested.

957
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,100
Do you want me to
go back to that corner?

958
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,240
Let's go.

959
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,810
Go in the corner where we were.

960
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,410
She chased me all around the shelter.

961
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,760
Wherever I'd go, two seconds
later, she'd show up there.

962
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,580
She's becoming a bit annoying.

963
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:58,300
Nobody really had a good
night's sleep because of her.

964
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:01,330
If you ruffle the feathers of tribe

965
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:13,850
everybody talked about
what they want to eat tonight?

966
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,100
We gotta boil the eggs.

967
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,060
Chicken.

968
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,429
You want chicken.

969
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:19,320
First challenge?

970
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:20,270
Heck, yeah.

971
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,730
The rooster ain't doing nothing anyway.

972
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,040
And he's biggest.

973
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,630
The other ones have a gimmick
at least they can make eggs.

974
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,280
We're thinking cooking a rooster,
depending on how much fish we get.

975
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:37,680
There are some parallels in how you decide which chicken to eat in
the same way you devour your enemies in the game of "Survivor."

976
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,710
If they're producing eggs they'll
probably stay around camp for a long time.

977
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,930
If they're not, they're going
to start hitting the barbecue.

978
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,420
Anybody want to do the
honor or should I go ahead?

979
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,690
You do it.

980
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,400
Go ahead.

981
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,690
Yeah, JT, he did it old school.

982
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:01,240
Oh, my God!

983
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,620
He just grabbed it by its neck
and spun it around until it was done.

984
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,920
Wow, you are so country.

985
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:11,550
My great-great grandmother did that to me one
time when I was three and scared the life about me.

986
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:16,719
He grabbed one and spun it around by its neck
and popped its head off and it ran around.

987
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,589
We were screaming.

988
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:18,690
We didn't know what to do.

989
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,580
It was traumatic.

990
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,570
It's funny now.

991
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,600
It smells good.

992
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,810
I can smell it already.

993
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,150
It's pretty good.

994
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:33,280
It is good.

995
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:37,080
You know, it's little victories
like the chick than get you fired up.

996
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:40,910
It just goes to show we
have sustainability out here.

997
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,160
That's a huge thing.

998
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,160
Thank you.

999
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:44,720
Thanks for cooking, boys.

1000
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:48,720
I think the Villains can
stay positive for a short time.

1001
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:52,020
But without fire, without
the small victories,

1002
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,780
it's only a matter of time
before that tribe self-destructs.

1003
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,720
Living large or Hero beach, James.

1004
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,700
It's good to be a Hero.

1005
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,420
Tree mail!

1006
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,620
This challenge is a big one.

1007
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,740
It's not for the stupid or weak.

1008
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,370
You've been here before, so save
your excuses at tribal council.

1009
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,600
Feel free to speak.

1010
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:20,240
Life's tough enough on the island,

1011
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,070
but suffering hunger and thirst,

1012
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:26,050
so don't add to the humiliation by
being the one who is voted off first.

1013
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,060
The Villains were beaten
the other day but not broken.

1014
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:39,930
Today, we build ourselves up again to go out
there and to thrash the Heroes unmercifully.

1015
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,920
Today is the difference
maker in whole game.

1016
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,500
We're gonna win.

1017
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:49,420
Hopefully we will not only defeat them
but we will beat them as well, mentally.

1018
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,740
And turn things around for the better.

1019
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,410
Villains!

1020
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,660
Get your evil on!

1021
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,490
I got my evil right here.

1022
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:57,230
Yeah.

1023
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:08,630
Jeff: Come on in, guys!

1024
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,819
So Heroes, you guys had
fire. JT, how's it going?

1025
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,190
Were you able to get fire going?

1026
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,289
Yeah, it's been pretty good, actually.

1027
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:34,130
We're staying a lot drier than I expected.

1028
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:38,120
Our roof is pretty thatched
pretty well so we kept dry.

1029
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,149
Tom how's the food?

1030
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:40,969
It's going pretty good.

1031
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:44,931
We got lucky with one rooster,

1032
00:59:44,932 --> 00:59:46,630
three hens, had a nice breakfast today.

1033
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,870
Jeff: Rob, what's going
on over at the Villains' camp?

1034
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:54,730
It's not quite as good as the way they're
talking over there our shelter is terrible.

1035
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:55,860
It's not that bad.

1036
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:56,990
It's terrible.

1037
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,499
It's really bad.

1038
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,374
Jeff: And there in lies the difference
between Coach, who can endure anything,

1039
01:00:02,885 --> 01:00:05,800
and the rest of us who would
like something to lie down on.

1040
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,450
You guys ready to get to
your first immunity challenge?

1041
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:09,949
Do it.

1042
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:10,659
Yeah.

1043
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,150
Jeff: All right, for today's challenge,
six tribe members will race to assemble a boat.

1044
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,440
You must then use seven planks
to keep the boat together.

1045
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,090
You'll paddle out, grab
a torch, paddle back,

1046
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:26,970
where you will remove the seven planks
and bring them back to the start.

1047
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,200
The four remaining tribe
members must then solve a puzzle.

1048
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:32,100
Once you have the puzzle completed,

1049
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:38,830
you will use those planks to build a ladder to allow
you to place the puzzle in its appropriate spot.

1050
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,500
It's then a race to the top.

1051
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,950
First tribe to get all their

1052
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:47,780
members to the top, light their
fire barrel, wins immunity.

1053
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,929
This is what you want in this game.

1054
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:52,980
If you have immunity, you are safe.

1055
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:55,930
You can't be voted out.
Without it, you are vulnerable.

1056
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:04,940
Losing tribe goes to tribal council where somebody will be
the first person voted out of "Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains."

1057
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:12,100
One item of note... both Candis and Parvati have both
competed in their challenge in their original season.

1058
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,049
In the Cook Islands they
were on the same tribe.

1059
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:14,890
They were winners.

1060
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,530
Today they are opponents.

1061
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,429
See how it plays out.

1062
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,240
I'll give you a minute to strategize
and we'll get started started.

1063
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:27,250
All right, here we go.

1064
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:31,330
At stake, immunity and for
the Villains, fire if they win.

1065
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:32,940
Survivors ready?

1066
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:33,709
Go!

1067
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:34,880
Come on, Heroes!

1068
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,030
Come on, Villains.

1069
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:40,760
Get ugly!

1070
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,880
Jeff: You need all the pieces.

1071
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:43,980
You need the planks.

1072
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,340
You need your paddles.

1073
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:46,740
You need all of it.

1074
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:54,740
Both tribes doing a good job of getting all their pieces
out in the water to start putting this boat together.

1075
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:56,740
James carrying two by himself.

1076
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,760
Hold that.

1077
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:01,739
Let's go, guys. Hey, let's go.

1078
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,849
We've got to put these together.

1079
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:04,070
Let's go, Heroes!

1080
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,900
Jeff: Heroes getting
it together quickly.

1081
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,109
Villains already falling behind.

1082
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:12,060
One small hole.

1083
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,180
Jeff: Gotta get those planks in.

1084
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,910
That's what's keeping your boat together.

1085
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:24,540
Parvati, Coach, Tyson, Courtney,
Russell and Danielle struggling early.

1086
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,930
Oh, my God.

1087
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:28,150
Everything strapped.

1088
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,139
Jeff: Heroes have their boat
together and they're heading out.

1089
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,410
Yeah, Heroes!

1090
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,430
Keep it up!

1091
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,950
Jeff: Heroes with a
nice lead right off the bat.

1092
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,390
Put it together.

1093
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,599
Jeff: Heroes doing a good job.

1094
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,100
Everybody working together.

1095
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,910
These three holes close together here.

1096
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,520
Jeff: Villains starting to panic
a little seeing that lead increase.

1097
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,940
Let's just cruise up on it.

1098
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,560
Jeff: Heroes are already at their fire.

1099
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,550
JT has the torch.

1100
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,450
Heroes are now heading back.

1101
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,040
Villains finally have their boat together.

1102
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:02,870
They're heading out.

1103
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,580
Heroes look like they've been
paddling together forever.

1104
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,140
Great rhythm.

1105
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:11,950
Everybody working together well.

1106
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,220
Good lead, guys!

1107
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,100
I hate them so bad.

1108
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:22,250
Jeff: Coach leading the tribe of Villains
using all of that life experience in a kayak.

1109
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:24,440
Got it.

1110
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,190
Jeff: Villains have their torch.

1111
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,279
Parvati lights it.

1112
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,620
Villains are now heading back.

1113
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,070
Only on the right.

1114
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,630
And stroke, stroke.

1115
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,400
Let's go, come on, guys!

1116
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:39,590
Run it in!

1117
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:40,189
Run it in!

1118
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:41,819
You now have to take that boat apart.

1119
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,190
You need those seven planks.

1120
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,830
Get those planks off!

1121
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:48,850
Jeff: Once you can get those
planks off, take them and get up there.

1122
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:51,109
Heroes have their planks.

1123
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,380
They're heading up to the puzzle.

1124
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:53,930
Good job, guys!

1125
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,750
Good job! Good job!

1126
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,870
Jeff: Gotta get your planks here
before you can start on your puzzle.

1127
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:02,750
Heroes now with an early lead.

1128
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:03,990
Working on this puzzle.

1129
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:06,810
Villains, you need to pick it up.

1130
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,320
Stroke! Stroke!

1131
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,680
Take your time. Don't panic.

1132
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,310
Jeff: This is a four-layer puzzle.

1133
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:20,270
In our 20th season of "Survivor," you can expect
difficult challenges and difficult puzzles.

1134
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,799
Get out, get out.

1135
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,759
Jeff: Villains are back.

1136
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,200
Get those seven planks and get back here.

1137
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,200
Come on, guys.

1138
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,350
Wait, wait, that's not right.

1139
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,250
Got it.

1140
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:32,640
Jeff: Villains heading
back with their seven planks.

1141
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:34,590
Come on, come on, come on!

1142
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:36,430
Jeff: Start!

1143
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,900
Villains now working on their puzzle.

1144
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,400
Villains hoping to make up some time.

1145
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:47,330
Rob, Sandra, Randy, Jerri working
on the puzzle for the Villains.

1146
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,889
There it is. That's it, that's it.

1147
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:52,590
Jeff: It's Amanda, Cirie, Sugar,
and Rupert working for the Heroes.

1148
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,329
The question is, did you pick the
right four to put the puzzle together?

1149
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,670
Something has to go down here.

1150
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,499
Come on, guys.

1151
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,080
You got it.

1152
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:02,730
Jeff: Rob and Sandra doing
a great job on the puzzle.

1153
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:03,970
I don't think

1154
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:05,029
something's not right.

1155
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:06,079
Something has to go here.

1156
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,830
Jeff: Amanda and cirie start to panic.

1157
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:11,310
Rupert now getting in it for the
Heroes, trying to get something going.

1158
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:14,570
Heroes have had a big lead
and it is all but gone.

1159
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:17,430
Jeff: Sandra and Rob
working together very well.

1160
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,610
You guys are doing a good job.

1161
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:20,669
That goes there

1162
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:22,300
Jeff: Sandra feeling very confident.

1163
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:25,430
Heroes not confident at all.

1164
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:31,630
Sugar watching it fall apart. And
the Heroes are back to the start.

1165
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,840
All the pieces out,
they are starting over.

1166
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:37,840
Villains are now in the
lead in this challenge.

1167
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,360
Only five pieces left. Are they right?

1168
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:45,330
Heroes still trying to figure out
the first piece of this puzzle.

1169
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:48,340
Maybe there are two different
pieces that fit into the same thing.

1170
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,090
Sugar now getting involved.

1171
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,120
Y'all calm down and
just let two people do it

1172
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:53,750
Jeff: Villains getting very close.

1173
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:54,890
Do they have it?

1174
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:56,110
They do!

1175
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:57,790
Villains have their puzzle completed.

1176
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,919
Villains have their puzzle put together.

1177
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,500
Now they have to put the seven planks
in the right spot to build a ladder.

1178
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,490
Heroes you need to keep it going going.

1179
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,240
Wait, wait, wait.

1180
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,790
Jeff: Villains with
a big come-from-behind.

1181
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,040
Villains have their ladder built.

1182
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,630
Got to put the puzzle in.

1183
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:19,380
Watch your hands.

1184
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:20,349
Jeff: It's in.

1185
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:21,779
Everybody to the top.

1186
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:22,630
Go, go, go!

1187
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,210
Jeff: It started at
as blowout for the Heroes.

1188
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,459
It is ending as a
blowout for the Villains.

1189
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,760
Light it up, light it up, light it up!

1190
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,040
Jeff: Villains win
first immunity challenge!

1191
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,400
Man!

1192
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,510
Jeff: Villains, congratulations.

1193
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,460
Immunity keeps you safe
from tribal council.

1194
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,220
Fire will hopefully
get your camp in order.

1195
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,250
Yes! >> yeah! >> yes!

1196
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:02,560
Jeff: Sugar, three days into this
game, right on cue, you're crying.

1197
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:03,710
Yeah.

1198
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:06,340
Jeff: All right, Heroes.

1199
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,909
Tribal council tonight.

1200
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:13,869
One of the 10 of you will be the first person
voted out of "Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains."

1201
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,120
Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.

1202
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:16,170
I will see you at tribal.

1203
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:17,750
Villains, congratulations.

1204
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,230
Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.

1205
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,730
Sugar is having some sort of
emotional breakdown on day three,

1206
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:26,970
she's not fit to be out
here another 36 days.

1207
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,290
Losing her, we're going to miss...

1208
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:33,640
Yeah, I don't think
we're going to miss much.

1209
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:52,540
Yeah!

1210
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:53,990
All right!

1211
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:55,130
Good job.

1212
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,210
Good work.

1213
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,190
Now we have a relaxing afternoon.

1214
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,250
Nobody has to go cut anybody's throat.

1215
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:04,530
We just have a nice night.

1216
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:07,760
It was exciting to win
the immunity challenge.

1217
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:15,120
We had to do it because we didn't want one of our
people to be the first to leave "Heroes vs. Villains."

1218
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:19,690
Now we're trying to figure out who
they're going to send home and why.

1219
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,390
Well, Tom and Stephenie are together.

1220
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:25,490
They were together from before.

1221
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:30,720
James has to be with cirie and
Amanda and what's the other one?

1222
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:33,119
I don't know if cirie
and Amanda are together

1223
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,860
when push comes to shove and
nobody wants to go home first,

1224
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,160
it's about who you've
been with and who you know.

1225
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:39,409
Yeah.

1226
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,460
What I like about it
is they all shook up now.

1227
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,790
Now they are divided.

1228
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,000
They have to divide them.

1229
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:49,790
The Heroes got their asses handed to them.

1230
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:53,480
And, you know what, we were having a
good time just sitting back loving it.

1231
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,270
Oh, I'm happy!

1232
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:57,279
Keep going, keep going.

1233
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:01,520
It strengthens our tribe and
it weakens the Heroes' tribe.

1234
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:04,020
We looked like a
team a little bit today.

1235
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:07,779
Like eight out of 10, eight I%...

1236
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:10,000
a solid b-plus.

1237
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,280
They have to stab somebody in the back.

1238
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,299
They're over there being Villains.

1239
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,450
That's what they're doing.

1240
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:27,430
This is not good.

1241
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:33,060
Nobody in a million years would have guessed
we are going to tribal council on day three.

1242
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:41,660
Hopefully this loss does nothing to our momentum
other than show us that we're vulnerable.

1243
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:47,960
They might be a little more sneaky and a little more game
play and a little more puzzle oriented, and that's fine.

1244
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:50,060
Well, they wanted it pretty bad.

1245
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,740
They needed it.

1246
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,740
And we were a little cocky.

1247
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,940
We walked in there like the Heroes.

1248
01:09:56,941 --> 01:09:59,780
You know, there's big
S's on all of our chests.

1249
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:08,690
This Heroes vs. Villians
is going to be a tough one.

1250
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:13,870
When we thought we had it in
the bag, they showed us we don't.

1251
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,650
You guys want some coconuts?

1252
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,110
Go see what trike looks like.

1253
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:22,870
Wasn't that interested.

1254
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:24,210
Neither was I.

1255
01:10:26,045 --> 01:10:28,800
I think Amanda should just go.

1256
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:29,680
Amanda?

1257
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:30,730
Okay.

1258
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:33,990
That's fine with me.

1259
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,150
As long as it's not me.

1260
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:36,681
Fricking awesome with me if... is concerned

1261
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,470
When... we lost, I
felt really, really awful.

1262
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,509
I helped us lose, I guess,
because I was on the puzzle,

1263
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:46,290
and I felt bad because we
had such a good lead before.

1264
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:50,630
I just of the disappointed
in myself and scared.

1265
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:53,810
I don't want to talk to anybody.

1266
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:54,860
Me, either.

1267
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,990
I'm so depressed right now.

1268
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:05,040
These are all people, some of them have all
played together before, and they're really good.

1269
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:10,370
And I think that Amanda and James are together
so we have to break that up, if at all possible.

1270
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,830
Sugar thinks it's Amanda.

1271
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:16,740
I don't agree with her on that.

1272
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,289
We got to go Sugar first.

1273
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:21,580
They're sitting fishing?? back right? No

1274
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:22,669
I think Sugar.

1275
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:24,640
I think everyone's thinking Sugar.

1276
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:25,820
Yeah.

1277
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:28,790
They want to do, um, Sugar tonight.

1278
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,400
Ye, that's what I figured.

1279
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:33,410
Sugar's going, right?

1280
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:34,700
I guess.

1281
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,270
Looks like Sugar.

1282
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,340
Is that done?

1283
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,530
Yeah.

1284
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,100
Yeah?

1285
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:42,880
Yeah.

1286
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:44,500
What are you thinking?

1287
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:50,670
I'm thinking that you have a follower and you have
one of the smartest strategic players in the game.

1288
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,619
Why are we taking out the follower
instead of the strategic player.

1289
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:58,660
Cirie has run this game a few times, so...

1290
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,059
I really believe that
when you identify a threat,

1291
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,629
you take them out as soon as possible.

1292
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:04,449
You don't wait.

1293
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:06,100
People did that on my season,

1294
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:07,399
and they waited too long.

1295
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,590
And then they didn't get the
opportunity to get rid of me.

1296
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:13,170
So I don't want to have those
regrets that those people had.

1297
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:14,939
I have no
problem... problem...

1298
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:16,460
just a thought. Just a thought.

1299
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:17,910
I'm down with that.

1300
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,910
Cirie is just a brilliant
strategist in the game.

1301
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:25,270
She's proven that, so I'm just
a little nervous to give her a

1302
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:37,420
so I told you three
my concerns about cirie.

1303
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,169
Cirie, I worry about her the most.

1304
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:40,790
Right.

1305
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,120
Cirie's tricky.

1306
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:46,770
So who are we voting for?

1307
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:47,520
That's what I'm...

1308
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,440
Sugar.

1309
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,770
They're voting for Sugar.

1310
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,669
Who's voting for sugar?

1311
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:51,500
The other group.

1312
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,990
Do we need to break
up Tom and Stephenie?

1313
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:55,690
I agree.

1314
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:57,300
Why waste a vote.

1315
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,940
And you're not going to
be able to get him later.

1316
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,199
Who are we voting?

1317
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,680
Tom or Stephenie.

1318
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,889
You have to make a decision
which one before we go back

1319
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:06,600
because we're not going
to be able to talk again.

1320
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,710
The word on the street is
Sugar is supposed to go tonight.

1321
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:11,630
Why Sugar?

1322
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:16,749
Sugar, yes, she's annoying which is even
a better reason for me to keep her around

1323
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:22,710
because as long as there's somebody
annoying and somebody Liz strong than I am,

1324
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,690
then that takes the target off of me.

1325
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:31,239
So if we could get one of the stronger players out
like Tom or Stephenie, that would be better for me.

1326
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,200
So I'd rather not have Sugar go tonight.

1327
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:39,970
My concern is if we don't knock
one of them out, like Stephenie,

1328
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:42,960
who... we're going to lose
challenges without Stephenie?

1329
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:43,680
Maybe.

1330
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,400
She's a really strong swimmer.

1331
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:47,550
And can't...
and Sugar is not?

1332
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,460
I don't think so

1333
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:50,590
I'm just...
you know.

1334
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:57,130
There is an advantage of keeping
Stephenie right now and getting rid of Sugar,

1335
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,050
physically, like, for the challenges.

1336
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:02,920
But strategically, Stephenie
has got game and she has to go.

1337
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,089
You think Stephenie?

1338
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:07,810
The smartest... the smartest
move right now would be Stephenie.

1339
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,780
I mean, think about it.

1340
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:13,990
We want to make moves that's gonna guarantee
you... us, you know, getting further in the game.

1341
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:16,920
It's so hard.

1342
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:21,020
You want to keep your team strong but strategically
you want to put yourself in a good position.

1343
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:27,880
Either you do it for challenges or you get rid of
someone for strategic reasons or you just don't like them.

1344
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:31,320
Cirie and I are here for blood, okay.

1345
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,340
We are here to win this thing.

1346
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,970
Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch.

1347
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,350
Go ahead and grab a torch.

1348
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,730
Approach your flame,
dip it in, and get fire.

1349
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:35,120
This is part of the ritual of
tribal council because in this game,

1350
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:38,830
as you know, fire represents your life.

1351
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:41,209
As long as you have fire,
you're still in the game.

1352
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:42,730
When your fire is gone, so are you.

1353
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,240
That will be the case
for one of you tonight.

1354
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:50,160
First, let me just welcome to you tribal.

1355
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:53,670
We're 40 feet in the air
in the middle of the jungle.

1356
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:54,790
No roof.

1357
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,560
If it rains, we will get wet.

1358
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:59,310
As I'm sure will happen
once or twice out here.

1359
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:03,920
I just want to look at some of the
reasons you might vote somebody off.

1360
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,230
Tom, how big a factor do you
think prior relationships,

1361
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:11,400
you and Stephenie, Amanda and cirie,

1362
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,639
people that have played together before that others
might look at and think they've got to be friends.

1363
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,509
They've got to be in an alliance.

1364
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:17,270
They know each other.

1365
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,270
I think we all worried
about that coming into it.

1366
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,209
I think it's pushed to the side.

1367
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:26,570
We realize you have to give everybody
a clean slate and take it from there.

1368
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:29,200
I'm not too worried about
previous relationships.

1369
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:31,940
Jeff: Sugar, you
haven't played with anybody.

1370
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,459
Do you buy what Tom is saying.

1371
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,960
It's fine, it's a clean slate.

1372
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:37,550
I don't care if they
knew somebody else before.

1373
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:43,110
I thought that was a really good
speech but I do think that is a factor,

1374
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:47,450
people who have played together and people who knew
each other and people who hang out, or whatever.

1375
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:49,690
Jeff: What about past success.

1376
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:54,140
Amanda, you've played twice, and
you've made it to the end both times.

1377
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:58,850
Do you find yourself already trying to deflect
some of the attention that might be on you?

1378
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:04,200
You know, one thing that I did in both my seasons
to get to the end was to make loyal alliances.

1379
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:07,400
So I think in a way it's
a positive thing for me.

1380
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:08,559
And, yeah, I haven't won.

1381
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,130
Like, obviously, we
all know I'm I'm...

1382
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:14,110
that was the best tribal
council question you answered.

1383
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:15,720
You answered that really correctly.

1384
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,040
I'm surprised.

1385
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:18,440
You said it out loud.

1386
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:22,760
Jeff: You're surprised and I'm excited.

1387
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,710
It took me a while, but
I'm getting the hang of it.

1388
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:27,609
So, yeah, it's both.

1389
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:29,520
I mean, there's people in
this game that have won.

1390
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,370
I mean, come on, you know.

1391
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:37,260
Jeff: Cirie, you're the woman that stayed
at home and watched "Survivor" on the couch

1392
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:42,720
and now here you are for the third time,
yet another reason to get rid of somebody.

1393
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,270
She's grown into a bona
fide threat to win the game.

1394
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:49,620
How do you defend that
first tribal council?

1395
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:53,640
Well, like you said, Jeff,
everybody here is a threat.

1396
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,450
If they weren't threatening,
they wouldn't be here.

1397
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:00,320
Jeff: Stef, that's really what we're
getting at, at this first tribal council.

1398
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,040
There's a reason to get rid
of every single person up here.

1399
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,500
Well, I think, as far as
trying to make a decision tonight,

1400
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:10,440
it's the first one, and
that's the hardest, I think.

1401
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:12,540
But we don't want to come back here.

1402
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:17,830
What I'm doing is I'm going to go with who I
think is the weakest for the team right now.

1403
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:21,330
And will help us... the strongest
help us continue to win.

1404
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:24,210
Jeff: Let's talk
about today's challenge.

1405
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:29,010
James, first half of the challenge
you guys smoked them by a long ways.

1406
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,600
Then we got to the puzzle.

1407
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:35,770
Amanda, Sugar, cirie, Rupert. Disaster.

1408
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,370
Nobody was focusing.

1409
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,230
Everybody had their own opinion.

1410
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,780
It was like everybody wanted
to solve the puzzle differently.

1411
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:47,000
But hopefully, they'll focus next time
because this just can't happen no more.

1412
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:51,620
Jeff: Cirie, if it's you
tonight is it fair to take it

1413
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:54,690
because you were one of the
people that blew it on the puzzle?

1414
01:18:55,510 --> 01:19:02,420
I don't think one challenge should determine
your worth in the long run of this game.

1415
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:06,710
It could be Tom and Stephenie, and
they could have lost the puzzle.

1416
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,930
Jeff: Sugar, you were one of the
four people that blew it on the puzzle.

1417
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:11,890
I know.

1418
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,530
Jeff: There's no debate about that.

1419
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,710
Would it be fair to say vote Sugar out?

1420
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,270
That's why I was crying.

1421
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,020
Jeff: Because you're afraid
that might be the reason.

1422
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:23,940
Jeff: Would that be criteria
enough for you to get rid of somebody?

1423
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:25,360
No, not me.

1424
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:31,410
I wouldn't vote somebody out just because they
were part of a team that didn't win the challenge.

1425
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,570
Jeff: Candice, you
gotta vote somebody out.

1426
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:38,100
Does it make it easier for to you say well
I could just simply blame it on the puzzle?

1427
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:42,280
I think the people who stepped
up to do the puzzle were pretty brave

1428
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:45,690
so I think we should appreciate
that they stepped up to do that

1429
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:49,540
and start voting people out for that because
otherwise nobody is ever going to do the puzzle.

1430
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:55,350
Jeff: Tom, do you vote tonight based
on long-term game or short-term game?

1431
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,520
I think people are
developing their relationships,

1432
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:01,390
and kind of everyone is always
looking towards the end game,

1433
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:04,379
but that's not what we're working on now.

1434
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,160
We're working on staying
strong with your best people

1435
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:11,010
and let's not come back here any more and we
don't have to worry about who we're voting out.

1436
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,780
Jeff: Candice, a lot of
these people know each other.

1437
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:19,970
Is the first tribal council maybe an opportunity to take
one person out of the equation and really change things up?

1438
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:23,410
I think the first tribal council
is an opportunity to do anything.

1439
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:28,330
We've got 10 people here, and there's
a lot of different ideas going around.

1440
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:32,520
So, yes or no.

1441
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,480
Jeff: All right, well, clearly,

1442
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:41,090
there's a legitimate reason to
vote every single person out.

1443
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:43,780
The only thing left to do is find
out who that person is going to be.

1444
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:45,650
It is time to vote.

1445
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,140
Candice, you're up.

1446
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,770
Jeff: I'll go tally the votes.

1447
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,870
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

1448
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:07,130
The person voted out will be asked to
leave the tribal council area immediately.

1449
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,270
I'll read the votes.

1450
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:13,600
First vote, Sugar.

1451
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:19,170
Sugar. Two votes Sugar.

1452
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:24,400
Sugar. That's three votes Sugar.

1453
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,380
Sugar. That's four votes Sugar.

1454
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:39,040
Amanda. Four votes Sugar, one vote Amanda.

1455
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:46,360
That's five votes Sugar, one vote Amanda.

1456
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:51,730
First person voted out of
"Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains."

1457
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:53,450
Sugar.

1458
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,259
Okay.

1459
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,400
Well, you all better win.

1460
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,890
Jeff: Sugar, the tribe has spoken.

1461
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:09,090
Time for you to go.

1462
01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:11,360
Bye.

1463
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,600
Jeff: All right first person
voted out of this game, a Hero.

1464
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:32,240
After you get back to camp and get your fire going,
should be one thing on your mind... getting even.

1465
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:35,960
Grab your torches. Head back
to camp. Try to stay dry.

Rob? Rob.

1469
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,500
You can open your eyes for us?

1472
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,400
it's not a great feeling to
be the first person voted off.

1473
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:25,650
I was crying today because I'm dramatic and
I felt like I lost the game for everybody.

1474
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:29,440
And I think they did probably make
the right decision in voting me out

1475
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:33,800
because..

1476
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:36,340
But...
