1
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,881
Fuck me.

2
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,250
I can't believe
I'm going to die in this place.

3
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,922
But, as far as headstones go,
a man could do a lot worse.

4
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,364
I'm Charlie Wolfe.

5
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,128
And as I lie here, waiting
for death's cold embrace,

6
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,886
I find myself asking
the question,

7
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,169
"How the fuck
did it come to this?"

8
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,284
I don't die. I thrive.

9
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,645
Fuck.

10
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,770
Argh!

11
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,211
Fuck!

12
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,884
Yeah? Yeah.

13
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,320
I'm... I'm sorry. Could you
hang on one second?

14
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,569
Yeah, I'll be there in an hour.

15
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,200
Good morning.
Doctor Webb Dental Surgery.

16
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,085
Hi, Lucy. This is Alice.

17
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,401
Hi, Alice.

18
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,608
Do you think Nathan
can see me this afternoon?

19
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,689
I'm actually in a lot of pain.

20
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,521
Sure. I think we can fit you in.

21
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,085
How's 2:00?

22
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,844
Perfect. I'll see you at 2:00.

23
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,604
Alright. See you later.

24
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,161
Nathan!

25
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,327
Come on, mate.

26
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,648
Please just sort me out
this one last time.

27
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,371
Fifty thousand on Silver Tsar
to win.

28
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,566
Thanks. You're a saint.

29
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,809
Nathan!

30
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,369
Change of plans.
She's coming today.

31
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,366
I'm not ready.

32
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,567
We've got no choice.

33
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,049
Switch my dental records and
let's get my car to the quarry.

34
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,200
Shit.

35
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,287
She's here.

36
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,280
Have you swapped
those dental records?

37
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,604
- Hi.
- Hi.

38
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,683
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

39
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,401
- What happened?
- Oh, I hit the door.

40
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,085
Oh, you poor thing!

41
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,282
Nathan, Alice is here!

42
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,250
- Hi, Nathan.
- Hi, Alice.

43
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,401
Okay.

44
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,211
- Yeah, shall we?
- Yeah.

45
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,329
Do I really need an injection?

46
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,849
Yes. But I will be gentle.

47
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,161
I think I...

48
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,448
Now, lie back... and open.

49
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,768
Took you long enough.
Is she out?

50
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,121
Cold.

51
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,210
- Grab her jewelry.
- Yeah.

52
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,690
- Did you see something?
- No.

53
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,930
You remember the petrol?

54
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,601
Must I think of everything?

55
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,085
There's a garage on the way.

56
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,560
Don't take forever.
I'll be waiting.

57
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,402
Ready to go
in the fifth event, Blacktown...

58
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,364
Silver Tsar's coming up...

59
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,603
Here's Silver Tsar
taking to the outside

60
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,001
and the well-tried favorite
lights up.

61
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,401
It's Silver Tsar racing
the Blacktown Lad and Daytone.

62
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,891
- He's taken over the running.
- Get up!

63
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,724
And the favorite's looking
really good at the moment.

64
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,240
He raced two lengths
in front of...

65
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,649
Not now, not now.
Please, not now.

66
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,727
Silver Tsar has the lead
but he's getting tired.

67
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,087
Daytone's coming back
and so is Madison Rose.

68
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,129
Oh, there's a fall!
The favorite's down!

69
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,920
- Shit!
- Silver Tsar's fallen.

70
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,360
- You wouldn't believe it.
- Shit!

71
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,646
Shit, shit, shit!

72
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,564
Victory in his sights
and he's down...

73
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,648
...wonder of the world, and down
he went with only 50m to go.

74
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,565
Que sera.
That's racing, I guess.

75
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,564
It's bad luck for the punters
that they lose their money.

76
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,889
Fucking hell!

77
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,041
Fuck!

78
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,481
Nathan, how are you going?

79
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,883
Uh, I'm alright.
I've just... just got a flat.

80
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,530
Oh, yeah. Need a hand?

81
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,047
Nah, all good. I got it.

82
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,645
No worries at all, mate.

83
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,081
Thanks.

84
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,126
You still planning on leaving?

85
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,169
I'm way beyond planning.

86
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,728
I'm doing. Today.

87
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,604
Good on you.

88
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,766
Do you need anything else?

89
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,081
Yeah, um...
you got any large waters?

90
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,720
Yeah, I've got some
out the back.

91
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,841
Thanks.

92
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,051
Are you a tourist?

93
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,920
Something like that.

94
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,320
Here you go.

95
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,763
Sorry it's not cold.
Just the one?

96
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,327
Uh, yeah, better give me
$20 worth of petrol.

97
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,641
Yeah, no worries.

98
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,644
You can't smoke in here.

99
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,810
Cheers, Dylan. Good luck.

100
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,884
What kept you this time?

101
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,280
I got a flat.

102
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,283
It's always something with you.

103
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,646
It was an accident.

104
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,802
Come on, then.
Let's get on with it.

105
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,689
It's you we should be insuring,
not me.

106
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,882
- Oh... shit!
- Oh, fuck!

107
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,731
Nathan!

108
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,206
Don't worry. It'll sink.

109
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,050
Soon.

110
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,521
Get in there!

111
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,370
Alright.

112
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,604
Fuck, Luce, it's really cold.

113
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,160
Let's go.

114
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,085
Fuck me.

115
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,451
Grab the bag.

116
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,928
- Petrol?
- In the back seat.

117
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,490
What the fuck is this?

118
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,641
It's the petrol.

119
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,245
Where's the rest of it?

120
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,566
That'll be enough.

121
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,881
Argh!

122
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,406
Alice...

123
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,281
calm down.

124
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,851
Ah!

125
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,406
Fuck!

126
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,567
Nathan, get up!
She's getting away!

127
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,165
Oh, fuck's sake!

128
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,287
Huh?

129
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,280
Oi!

130
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,651
Lucy!

131
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,001
Fuck.

132
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,489
- Hey.
- Let's fucking do this.

133
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,041
- Where is she?
- In the back seat.

134
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,803
- Jewelry's on the dash.
- Yeah.

135
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,691
Just get her in.

136
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,365
Not so fucking easy.

137
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,404
Hey, you don't have to be so gentle.
Just get her in there.

138
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,131
Okay.

139
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,041
Ow.

140
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,845
Sorry, Alice.

141
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,010
Goodbye, Alice.

142
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,566
No, I'm fine.
I can't. I'm working.

143
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,926
Great.

144
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,601
Alright, ready?

145
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,000
Cheers!

146
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,486
I agreed to help out

147
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,520
but not so you can sit around
on your fucking ass.

148
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,886
I'll be another minute.

149
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,971
- Jack, we need to talk.
- Not now.

150
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,411
Your marriage is a joke.

151
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,285
She's given up
on your whole pathetic act.

152
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,765
Do you know
that you're the la...

153
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,411
Enough.

154
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,763
Why don't you
and your deadbeat husband

155
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,763
mind your own fucking business?

156
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,689
Jack, you're my brother.

157
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,446
I can't just stand by
and watch this happen.

158
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,965
Are you done?

159
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,770
Have you made that call?

160
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,081
Hire him and have her followed.

161
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,089
If I'm wrong,
then I won't say another word.

162
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,922
Jack, we need to get
more tequi...

163
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,530
When did you get a gun?

164
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,851
Is everything okay?

165
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,286
Sit down.

166
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,811
Pick it up.

167
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,331
Please put the gun down.

168
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,130
I said pick it fucking up.

169
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,088
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

170
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,410
You don't love me.

171
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,244
You just want to control me.

172
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,491
Alice.

173
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,409
Are you seeing someone else?

174
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,362
'Cause I couldn't handle
something like that.

175
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,084
I'd sooner see you dead.

176
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,291
I need to go.

177
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,883
Yeah.

178
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,525
Sorry, just hold on a sec.

179
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,970
Yeah, I'll be there in an hour.

180
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,647
- What are you doing?
- Jack, you're hurting me.

181
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,930
What are you fucking doing
sneaking around?

182
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,286
I wasn't sneaking around.

183
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,484
That's the last time you hit me.

184
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,284
Alice, I'm sorry!

185
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,601
Ow.

186
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,530
Yeah, your tooth is chipped.

187
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,646
Sorry, it's all I've got.

188
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,731
Thank you.

189
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,288
You'll be okay on your own
for a few?

190
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,006
Why? Where are you going?

191
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,405
I'm gonna pay Jack a visit.

192
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,131
Dylan... Dylan.

193
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,526
Dylan!

194
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,685
Come here.

195
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,281
Stay with me.

196
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,283
Somebody needs to
sort that prick out.

197
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,210
Stay with me.

198
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,851
Please?

199
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,800
Please.

200
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,040
Ooh!

201
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,402
Jack wasn't always like this.

202
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,688
Doesn't excuse what he does.

203
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,809
You know what he told me
earlier?

204
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,443
That he'd sooner see me dead
than with another guy.

205
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,170
He actually said that?

206
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,569
The scariest part...

207
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,961
...is that he was pointing this at me
when he said that.

208
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,200
Fucking hell.

209
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,644
Good thing we're leaving
tomorrow.

210
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,170
You sure you want to go?

211
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,768
Of course I'm sure.

212
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,327
But you haven't sold
the garage yet.

213
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,845
Things will be tight.

214
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,326
Money's always a problem
when you don't have much.

215
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,722
I'll get a job.

216
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,562
We can make enough
for the both of us.

217
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,681
Sure. I think we can fit you in.

218
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,760
How's 2:00?

219
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,331
Perfect. I'll see you at 2:00.

220
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,811
Alright. See you later.

221
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,001
Nathan!

222
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,725
Are you sober?

223
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,046
Mostly.

224
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,606
I'm sorry, Alice.

225
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,091
You're always sorry.

226
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,367
- Yeah.
- This is Charlie Wolfe.

227
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,567
Hang on.

228
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,529
Oi. Shut the door?

229
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,446
Yeah.

230
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,568
I have something
you might want to see.

231
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,085
Okay.

232
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,526
Should I drop in?

233
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,920
No.

234
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,167
You know the car park
by Merchant Rock?

235
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,845
I'll be there in an hour.

236
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,604
Hey, Bruce.

237
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,805
Where's Jack?

238
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,450
In his office.

239
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,530
You must be tired.

240
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,284
Yeah, a little.

241
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,522
Running around town
the way you do.

242
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,409
All hours of the day and night.

243
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,931
Excuse me?

244
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,649
- Bruce.
- Jack. The very man.

245
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,081
Just checking on that
case of whisky you promised.

246
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,322
Is later alright, mate?
I'm just heading out.

247
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,008
Yeah. Long as it's not
too much later.

248
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,605
Right?

249
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,844
Give us your car keys.

250
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,081
What's wrong with your car?

251
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,770
It's still at the paint shop.

252
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,090
Will you be long?

253
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,050
As long as it takes.

254
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,323
I have an appointment
with Nathan at 2:00.

255
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,965
Fuck.

256
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,646
Shit.

257
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,725
Wolfe!

258
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,369
I didn't expect your call
so soon.

259
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,602
Sometimes
they make it too easy.

260
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,560
This was last night?

261
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,165
Jesus.

262
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,520
Do you have something for me?

263
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,366
I'm keeping this.

264
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,006
Be my guest.

265
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,650
I bought it just for you.

266
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,763
You feel like staying on
for a few days?

267
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,284
No sense hanging around.

268
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,602
I've got something for you,
if you're interested.

269
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,761
I'm listening.

270
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,410
How does 50 grand sound?

271
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,444
Like a dirty job.

272
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,644
And I'm still listening.

273
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,369
I want you to kill my wife.

274
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,568
Make the bitch disappear.

275
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,730
Jack, you've worked yourself
into a knot over this thing.

276
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,006
Fine.

277
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,401
You're reacting badly
to some bad news.

278
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,001
- Just take some time.
- My mind is clear.

279
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,085
What you're talking about is a
one-way street. You understand?

280
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,164
Once you start,
there is no going back.

281
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,363
She's had fair warning.

282
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,527
She knew the consequences
and she did it anyway.

283
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,086
So fuck her.

284
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,165
You want my money or not?

285
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,242
Do you have that sort
of cash just lying around?

286
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,606
It's covered.

287
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,211
I mean untraceable.

288
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,600
This kind of job
doesn't come with a receipt.

289
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,045
I told you, it's covered.

290
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,567
There is, of course,
the issue of trust.

291
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,801
I trust you.

292
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,081
Yes, but how can I be sure

293
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,964
you're not gonna go soft
on me, Jack?

294
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,969
Well, we'll have to
trust each other.

295
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,202
Did you and your wife
ever trust each other?

296
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,769
You don't want the job? Fine.
Forget I asked.

297
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,644
I don't remember saying no.

298
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,370
So are you saying yes?

299
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,485
Alright, I'll do it.

300
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,209
But not for 50 grand.

301
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,051
How much?

302
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,611
My rate's an even one.

303
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,086
Sixty?

304
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,561
No, 100.

305
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,723
I'm what you call
a professional.

306
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,609
Quality always costs.

307
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,970
So are we on?

308
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,847
She has a dental
appointment at 2:00.

309
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,161
I'd be fine with her
never coming home.

310
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,640
Alright, here's
what I want you to do.

311
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,486
Go back to the bar,
and stay there, in plain sight.

312
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,847
Smile for everyone,
and don't act funny.

313
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,365
I'll contact you
when it's done.

314
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,563
I'll be expecting your call.

315
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,325
Oh, Jack?

316
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,640
Don't go putting that online, now,
will you?

317
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,645
Lucy.

318
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,285
I can't go through with it.

319
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,325
Can't?

320
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,206
Shit.

321
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,005
Whatever he wants,
get rid of him.

322
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,326
I'll handle it.

323
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,882
G'day, Bruce.
How are you going?

324
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,280
I was up the big smoke
last night.

325
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,050
Met a bookmaker we all know.

326
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,369
- Who's that?
- Evan Black.

327
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,126
- You know Evan?
- He's a relative.

328
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,485
I had no idea.

329
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,329
You know how it is around here.

330
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,164
We're all related
one way or another.

331
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,927
Yeah. Small world.

332
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,969
Evan says
you've been avoiding him.

333
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,921
Says you owe him
heaps of money,

334
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,724
and so far you haven't made
good on a single marker.

335
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,089
Look, it's okay.
I am gonna pay him.

336
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,208
- I gave him my word.
- Fuck your word.

337
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,286
He wants his money.

338
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,569
And he will get it, on my oath.

339
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,289
You disrespected him.

340
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,648
He arranged for the lads
to come see you.

341
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,370
But I talked him out of it.

342
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,689
I said I'd come see you first.

343
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,361
Promised him I'd collect
everything you owe.

344
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,681
Within the week.

345
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,411
Failing that...
I'd kill you meself.

346
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,008
Bruce... we're good
for the money.

347
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,481
Well, we will be.

348
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,242
I just need
a little bit more time.

349
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,286
How much time?

350
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,720
Couple of months.

351
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,082
- You're taking the piss.
- No.

352
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,843
Where's this money
coming from in a few months?

353
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,804
I can't tell you,
but it is real, okay? I promise.

354
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,088
Don't come
the raw fuckin' prawn.

355
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,730
You've got one week.

356
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,167
We're talking about
near 250 grand.

357
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,049
That was before.

358
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,884
- Before what?
- Me.

359
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,641
How much now?

360
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,410
Now?

361
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,364
Now we're talking about
a figure so close to $300,000

362
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,965
we may as well call it that.

363
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,043
No, we never agreed to that.
Are you insane?

364
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,089
- Non-negotiable.
- You can't be serious.

365
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,607
Let me show you how serious
I am. Come here.

366
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,046
Nah, it's alright.

367
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,487
- Bruce, please.
- Don't have me ask twice.

368
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,768
Argh, Bruce! Bruce!

369
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,040
You've got one week.

370
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,481
Now, say it.

371
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,930
Bruce, stop.

372
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,764
You think he got the message?

373
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,602
- Well?
- Yes.

374
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,007
Bruce, we get it, okay?
We've got a week.

375
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,491
Or else?

376
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,209
I'm asking you.

377
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,006
Or...

378
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,764
You'll kill us.

379
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,085
Have the money in a week.

380
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,160
Lucy,
I'm sorry.

381
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,606
Don't touch me!

382
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,724
You just stood there.

383
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,647
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

384
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,084
We go ahead with it.

385
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,966
We need that insurance money
more than ever now.

386
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,321
Okay.

387
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,410
Where have you been? I'm late.

388
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,005
Went for a drive.

389
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,286
My car keys?

390
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,727
♪ This relationship is dead ♪

391
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,202
♪ Is dead, oh, no, no ♪

392
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,445
♪ Oh, it's dead... ♪

393
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,650
Goodbye, Alice.

394
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,404
Oh, my God!

395
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,609
Shit! No!

396
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,164
How do you like their house?

397
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,963
Are you certain
they're overseas?

398
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,690
For the next six months.

399
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,882
You do know the code,
don't you?

400
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,527
Max told me there was
an easy way to remember it.

401
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,404
Obviously.

402
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,970
Beethoven.

403
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,690
- What?
- The code.

404
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,770
It's 1812, after the overture.

405
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,840
That's Tchaikovsky, you idiot.

406
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,361
Shit.

407
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,366
Lucy, have you got
any of my contacts here?

408
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,566
Yeah.

409
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,369
In my toiletry bag.
I'll get it.

410
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,371
What's that?

411
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,688
I was gonna tell you about it.

412
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,401
I found it in her car when
I was waiting for you earlier.

413
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,643
It just slipped my mind
with all that was going on.

414
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,211
How much?

415
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,206
About...$250,000.

416
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,369
Quarter of a million dollars.

417
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,770
And you just forgot about it?

418
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,203
We didn't have to kill her,
did we?

419
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,486
What are you talking about?!

420
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,880
We could have used
that money to pay Bruce.

421
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,771
By the time I found it,
we were already committed.

422
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,290
Very convenient.

423
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,684
Believe me,
there is nothing convenient

424
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,008
about this mess
that you got us into!

425
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,480
Hey.

426
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,285
Hey.

427
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,727
I'm sick and tired of
having barely enough.

428
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,769
I want more.

429
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,289
So should you.

430
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,366
I'm off.

431
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,524
Why?
Why do you have to leave?

432
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,808
I'll come back
when I get a chance.

433
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,360
Okay.

434
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,684
Why are you taking that?

435
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,209
I'll keep it safe.

436
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,840
Hello, Jack.

437
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,007
- You.
- Me.

438
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,201
Is it done?

439
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,885
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't.

440
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,405
She's dead?

441
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,651
- How'd you do it?
- Oh, easy there, Jack.

442
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,450
The less you know, the better.

443
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,005
That way, if people
start asking questions,

444
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,844
you don't have to lie.

445
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,569
- She's...
- Gone.

446
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,005
Forever.

447
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,809
You planning on drinking
yourself to death, Jack?

448
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,125
Maybe.

449
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,289
Your business is your own.

450
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,810
As long as we're square.

451
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,450
You got some proof for me?

452
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,046
Or am I supposed to
just take your word?

453
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,165
What, you don't trust me
anymore?

454
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,840
I'd have thought you'd be glad
to be rid of her.

455
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,560
Answer to all your problems.

456
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,483
Despite what you think,

457
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,290
I love my wife very much.

458
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,406
Too much.

459
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,927
Well, you've got
a crazy way of showing it.

460
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,322
Nobody makes a fool out of me.

461
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,166
It's gone.

462
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,843
I don't like the sound of that.

463
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,005
Alice.

464
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,928
You wouldn't be playing games
with me, would you, Jack?

465
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,366
What?

466
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,285
No, don't worry. I have more.

467
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,010
Where?

468
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,004
At the safety deposit box
at the bank.

469
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,083
Had me worried for a moment.

470
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,603
What time shall I
come back tomorrow?

471
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,561
Give me till 3:00.

472
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,131
Let's make it 2:00.

473
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,766
Jack, all this talk of booze
has got me quite thirsty.

474
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,287
You wouldn't know of any good
bars in the area, would you?

475
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,200
Shit.

476
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,400
Hi, Bruce.

477
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,525
Where's Lucy?

478
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,561
Oh, she hasn't
showed up for work yet.

479
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,250
You know why I'm here?

480
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,731
Yeah.

481
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,880
You said I had a week,
so that gives me at least...

482
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,485
Don't play games.

483
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,124
I'm here on police business.

484
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,769
You know anything
about a crash?

485
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,730
Up on Devil's Rocks Road?

486
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,330
No. Should I?

487
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,764
I didn't think
you had the balls, mate.

488
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,161
What are you talking about?

489
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,085
I found Lucy's car,
or what's left of it.

490
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,286
This thing has insurance job
written all over it.

491
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,444
Don't bullshit me.

492
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,767
You got a policy
in your wife's name?

493
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,600
Yes.

494
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,245
Well, one word from me
in the wrong man's ear

495
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,483
and that claim won't clear
for a bloody long time.

496
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,208
But I'm also in a position
to make this thing

497
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,364
go your way without a hitch,
open and shut case.

498
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,482
But for these services,
I need to be compensated.

499
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,610
I'm listening.

500
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,964
- I want half.
- Half?

501
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,522
Mmm, half of what's left
after you settle your debts.

502
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,966
No way!

503
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,008
Consider your options, Nathan.

504
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,845
Okay? I'm being very generous.
Don't insult me.

505
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,002
You got a copy of your wife's
dental records?

506
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,200
Hey? Save me a trip back here
after I ring this in.

507
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,651
Yes.

508
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,131
Here.

509
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,324
I underestimated you, mate.

510
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,646
Your own wife.

511
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,089
You're a heartless fucker.

512
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,681
Luce.

513
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,446
Lucy!

514
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,281
Lucy!

515
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,685
Bit of a problem.

516
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,251
Read this.

517
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,324
When did you get this?

518
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,891
Earlier.

519
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,449
Do you have any idea
who sent it?

520
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,880
No.

521
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,766
Do you?

522
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,524
What? Of course not.

523
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,527
Two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars.

524
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,364
Bit of a coincidence,
don't you think?

525
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,048
The email says
he's watching us.

526
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,441
He?

527
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,250
Oh, you think it's a she?

528
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,925
Maybe.

529
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,562
- You're being ridiculous.
- Am I?

530
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,041
Well, he or she, all they
mention here is 250 grand.

531
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,646
So?

532
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,609
So obviously they don't know
about the insurance policy

533
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,171
or they'd be after a lot more.

534
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,404
You think we should pay?

535
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,891
Fuck.

536
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,044
I think we have a chance
to end this cheap.

537
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,645
Cheap?

538
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,241
In comparison.

539
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,842
Besides, I don't see
too many options.

540
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,931
Maybe.

541
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,804
You still have the money,
don't you?

542
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,966
In the car.

543
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,485
Why?

544
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,240
Thought maybe you'd
gambled it away already.

545
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,890
Don't start.

546
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,603
- You coming?
- Where?

547
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,489
Where do you think?

548
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,969
I'm dead, remember?

549
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,807
Where is she?

550
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,325
Come here.

551
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,331
Who the fuck
do you think you are

552
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,847
coming in here
accusing me of what, exactly?

553
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,570
I want to know what you did.

554
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,290
What about what you did?

555
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,964
I had you followed.

556
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,407
- I want my money back.
- What money?

557
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,041
I know she took it,
I know she gave it to you,

558
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,327
and I want it back.

559
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,527
I haven't got your money.

560
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,289
Is that right?

561
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,842
You looking for this? Hmm?

562
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:54,926
Where is she?

563
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,725
You gonna shoot me?

564
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,643
Just tell me where she is.

565
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,885
Fuck you.

566
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,690
Argh!

567
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,286
Argh! Fuck!

568
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,527
You fucking shot me!
You fucking prick!

569
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,805
Where is she?!

570
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,365
I don't know!

571
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,204
He wouldn't tell me.

572
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,486
Who?

573
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,608
The guy I hired.
The one who shot the video!

574
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,842
- What's his fucking name?
- Wolfe! Charlie Wolfe!

575
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,604
Where can I find him?

576
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,962
Here, a little later.

577
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,331
Why?

578
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,202
He still has to get paid.

579
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,210
Paid for what?

580
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,643
Making her disappear.

581
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,521
How will I recognize him?

582
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,921
He drives a Toronado.

583
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,524
- The tourist.
- Yeah, he's no tourist.

584
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,569
So, how are we gonna do this?

585
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,485
Well, that's the easy part.

586
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,648
You just put the money
on the ground

587
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,320
and then get in your car
and fuck off.

588
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,165
Not a chance.

589
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,882
We do this face-to-face
or not at all.

590
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,930
You don't
get to call the shots.

591
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,964
You consider this
a down payment.

592
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,565
I'll keep the memory card

593
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,688
until the insurance policy's
cleared.

594
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,205
Over my dead body.

595
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,330
Isn't that over
your wife's dead body?

596
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,481
You go to hell!

597
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,927
You've got a bad attitude.

598
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,121
Look, your money is here,

599
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,362
and so am I
until you come and collect it.

600
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,602
Or I could just shoot you
where you stand,

601
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,489
come and take the money.

602
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,880
What,
and kill the only person

603
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,530
that can claim
the insurance policy?

604
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,531
I don't think so.

605
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,126
Ow! Argh!

606
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,964
- Yes!
- Fuck!

607
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,531
Fuck!

608
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,888
You know,
I'd prefer not to kill you.

609
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,451
But I will.

610
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,724
Just so we're clear.

611
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,883
- This ends today.
- Whatever you say.

612
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,290
Argh!

613
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,891
God! Ow!

614
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,563
Fuck!

615
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,050
Do you find something funny?!

616
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,763
You're a fucking lunatic!
You know that?

617
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,168
- Look in the bag.
- Why?

618
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,923
'Cause I want to see your face.

619
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,729
That wife of yours.

620
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,323
She's something, right?

621
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,002
Leave her alone.

622
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:12,364
Tell me where the fucking money
is or she eats this gun.

623
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,121
If I tell you...

624
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,645
Then I won't kill her.

625
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,684
- Give me your word.
- I promise.

626
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,891
It's in the boot.

627
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,523
The keys are... in my pocket.

628
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,684
Argh!

629
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,891
- Now...
- Yeah?

630
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,722
...I will be sure
to tell your wife

631
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,564
what you tried to do for her.

632
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,484
You promised me.

633
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,928
You promised...

634
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,645
No.

635
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,925
No!

636
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:27,926
Jack?

637
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,691
Jack?

638
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,769
I could murder a drink.

639
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,964
Despite how this looks,
I had nothing to do with it.

640
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:25,563
Hey!
Hey! Hey!

641
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,121
Dylan!

642
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,045
Boo!

643
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,486
Fuck!

644
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,329
What the fuck
are you doing here?

645
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,131
Dammit!

646
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,009
What happened?

647
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,325
He fucking stabbed me.

648
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,084
What, Nathan?

649
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,521
Yeah.
What a complete psycho.

650
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,409
- But you got the money?
- Oh, I got it.

651
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,925
Where's Nathan now?

652
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,770
Yeah, about that.

653
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:18,126
- What about it?
- Um...

654
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,164
Did you fuck this up?

655
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,126
Honey, I'm having
a bad day here.

656
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,841
You killed him?

657
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,121
He forced my hand.

658
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,691
Do you realize
what you've done?

659
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,161
It was him or me, okay?
Sorry.

660
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,651
Dammit, Charlie!

661
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,326
You wanted him dead.

662
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,721
Yeah, after
the insurance settlement.

663
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,848
What can I say?
The guy flipped.

664
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,126
Un-fucking-believable.

665
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,960
You had a simple job
and you fucked it up.

666
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,650
Don't try to blame this on me.

667
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,926
You're the one
who couldn't wait.

668
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,686
You wanted the 250 now,
so I sorted it.

669
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,444
Sorted it?

670
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,841
You weren't meant to kill him,
you idiot!

671
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,405
Watch your mouth.

672
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,891
How the fuck do we get
the insurance money

673
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,161
without Nathan?

674
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,480
Thanks to your incompetence,
our plan's utterly ruined.

675
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,688
That's just great, Charlie.

676
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,560
Your husband might have
put up with your shit.

677
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,722
Don't mistake me for him.

678
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,281
Well, I'd like to say
it's been a pleasure.

679
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,566
What do you mean?

680
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,324
I'm leaving.

681
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,164
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

682
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,482
Not in this life.

683
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,404
You can't just leave.

684
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,449
What were you expecting?

685
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,363
- But...
- What, because we fucked?

686
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,724
Consider it a fringe benefit.

687
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,689
We split the money first.

688
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,884
No need to be greedy.

689
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,522
You're about to inherit
the hotel.

690
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,764
What are you talking about?

691
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,086
You'll see.

692
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,920
I'll see what?

693
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,445
So long, honey.

694
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,525
- Give me the card!
- What?

695
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,484
The card! The memory card
from the camera.

696
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,170
Give it to me!

697
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,844
You are either the craziest
or the cleverest bitch

698
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,411
I have ever met.

699
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,290
I can't decide.

700
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,645
Ow!

701
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,524
What the fuck?!

702
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,205
Dylan, what are you doing here?

703
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,771
I could ask you the same thing.

704
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,129
God, this place is like a
fucking open-air insane asylum!

705
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,963
- Is this what you did it for?
- Did what?

706
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,282
Don't play dumb.
Jack filled me in on your deal.

707
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,930
No, look,
you've got it all wrong.

708
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,560
- Don't fucking lie.
- I didn't touch her.

709
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,889
He's lying. He did it.
He killed Alice.

710
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,565
You fucking snake!

711
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,603
And he killed Nathan.

712
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,447
Look, if you want to know
who killed Alice, she did.

713
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,605
Dylan, I swear to God...

714
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,125
Look, I can prove it.

715
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,442
- He's lying!
- Shut the fuck up!

716
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,045
I know you killed her.

717
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,083
She's dead, and so are you.

718
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,645
Nice shot!

719
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,491
I...

720
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,845
Fuck's sake.

721
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,370
Time we put you
out of your misery.

722
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,645
No, no! No! No!

723
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,364
I took the money.

724
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,965
I know.

725
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,611
What?

726
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,326
Yeah?

727
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,925
