00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:18,025
(school bell ringing)

3
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:21,829
(Barney burps)

4
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:23,097
(tires screeching)

5
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:26,000
D'oh!

6
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:27,034
(tires screech)

7
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,702
Not again!

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,605
(classical music playing)

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,340

11
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:02,836
Now, I, Bart Simpson,

12
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:05,472
shall send the first coaster
down the track.

13
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:06,507
Hmm.

14
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,145
(Milhouse grunts)

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,547
(gasping)

16
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:19,720
No, for once,
I want to go first.

17
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:22,656
But, Milhouse, I already
let you push me on the swings.

18
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:25,159
And it's an honor,
but I'm doing this.

19
00:01:25,193 --> 00:01:27,061
Ow! Knock it off, Milhouse!

20
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:28,162
(grunting)

21
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:31,131
(yells)
Eat safety bar!

22
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,734
(muffled):
Why are we best friends?

23
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:36,470
Because your seat
was behind mine!

24
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:37,905
(both grunting)

25
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,940
(groans)

26
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:43,243
(both crying)

27
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:47,081
Feels like this playdate's
gone on forever.

28
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:48,415
I'll handle this.

29
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,752
"Dear Weirdo,
pick up weirdo kid."

30
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:52,786
And send.

31
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,787
Aah!

32
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,789
(gasps)
Did you eat a peanut?

33
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,025
No, I just sniffed a nectarine.

34
00:01:58,059 --> 00:01:59,326
It's okay.

35
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:01,462
I can breathe
through my tear ducts.

36
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,431
(whistling)

37
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:05,966
Tell me if this
gets annoying.

38
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,801
(whistling continues)

39
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,271
I think I'm gonna throw up
the mac and cheese you fed me.

40
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:12,506
I'm not supposed to have it.

41
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,109
That's why I had so much.

42
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:16,710
HOMER:
What the...?!

43
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:19,680
If this kid's dad isn't
here in one second,

44
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:22,016
he's going in the garbage can.

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,617
(car honks)

46
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:25,185
Hey, guys!

47
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,955
Who wants a whiff
of New Kirk Smell?

48
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:29,089
"YOLO"?

49
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:30,891
You Only Live Once.

50
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:33,093
Once again, cats have it better.

51
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:34,561
Kirk Van Houten.

52
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:37,364
I hope you're not having
a midlife crisis.

53
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,466
Please.
Just 'cause I bought a new car,

54
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:40,634
lost a little weight

55
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,536
and started taking
a DJ class,

56
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,339
everyone thinks
I'm having a midlife crisis.

57
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,441
Dad! You got me
a skateboard?

58
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:48,676
It's for me.

59
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,843
Now get in the back.

60
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,011
And while you're there,

61
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,280
use this cream to
massage the leather.

62
00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:55,816
(leather squeaking)

63
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,419
To the tooth-whitening kiosk!

64
00:02:58,453 --> 00:02:59,620
(laughing)

65
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:03,190
I'm sorry, but does Kirk
know how silly he looks?

66
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,558
Look at me!

67
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:06,827
I'm afraid of dying.
(laughs)

68
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:08,228
Oh, Homie.

69
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:09,830
I'm so glad you're happy

70
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:12,599
with your life
just the way it is.

71
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:15,135
You've had the same
job, same car,

72
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,038
same house for 20 years.

73
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,274
And that's all
you'll ever have.

74
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:22,743
A cycle you'll never ever,

75
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:24,878
ever, ever, ever,

76
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,914
ever change.

77
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:29,383
And you're okay with it!

78
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:33,554
Like I say night after night

79
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,322
after night...

80
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:37,357
nighty-night.

81
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,061
(birds chirping)

82
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:44,631
Kent Brockman is here
for your interview.

83
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:02,716
So, Kent, what brings you here?

84
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,085
The miraculous tale
of how we lost, then found,

85
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,987
our Lost and Found box?

86
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:08,789
Actually, Principal Skinner,
I'm here to talk

87
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:09,923
about something else...

88
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,924
cheating!

89
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,092
(chuckles)

90
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,094
I thought this was a puff piece.

91
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,295
You're wearing a sweater.

92
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,898
This journalism just turned...

93
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:19,666
gotcha!
(gasps)

94
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:21,835
That's right, Channel 6
will uncover the truth

95
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,505
in a five-part series
two minutes a day.

96
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,107
People, make room for your local
Emmy nomination certificates.

97
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,842
No, do not make room.

98
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,377
Except for Mr. Largo
and his diet,

99
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:31,845
there's no cheating
in this school.

100
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,180
These 30 identical

101
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:36,116
"What I Did This Summer"
essays say different.

102
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,317
Um...

103
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:46,293
Myra, don't I have
another appointment?

104
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,962
Oh, this is your first
appointment ever.

105
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,064
Let's take a look
at this monitor.

106
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:57,471
<i>This school is more corrupt</i>
<i>than the Italian parliament.</i>

107
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,972
<i>If these children</i>
<i>are our future,</i>

108
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,376
<i>then I, for one,</i>
<i>do not want to live.</i>

109
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,317
(quietly):
Ha-ha.

110
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,487
Please don't air this.

111
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,689
I'll tell you the winners of
the kickball games in advance.

112
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:17,691
You can make a lot of cabbage
betting on K-ball.

113
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:19,827
And that's what we'll end
the story with.

114
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,628
No!

115
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:22,963
This is Kent Brockman.

116
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:25,132
Pleased with himself.

117
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,034
♪ You only

118
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:30,404
♪ Live once

119
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,472
♪ Or so it seems

120
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:37,978
♪ No life for yourself

121
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:42,416
♪ And none for your dreams

122
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:45,752
♪ You work

123
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:48,722
♪ Every day

124
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:54,194
♪ At a job so lame

125
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,130
♪ And every night

126
00:05:57,165 --> 00:06:01,034
♪ The ending's the same.

127
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,238
♪ No dream will come true

128
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:05,405
♪ You only

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,843
♪ Live once.

130
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:11,078
(deep breath)

131
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:13,013
(crying to the tune of
"You Only Live Twice")

132
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:19,052
(higher-pitched crying)

133
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,889
Yeah, well, at least you
got your health, huh?

134
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,091
Now let's see if I can
take that away from you.

135
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,660
Your poison.

136
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:29,796
(groans)
I'm tired of living once.

137
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:31,465
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

138
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:34,268
but I'm starting to
regret saying "YOLO."

139
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:36,503
Marge, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna quit complaining

140
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:40,140
about my life and start
wallowing in the past.

141
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:42,609
Postage, marked in pesetas?

142
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:44,044
Who are those letters from?

143
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:45,979
My old pen pal from Spain.

144
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:47,614
Eduardo.
Hmm.

145
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,016
Back in fifth grade,
you either had to write

146
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,884
to a foreigner
or a prisoner.

147
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:52,319
I picked a foreigner
because the prisoners

148
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:54,254
wrote back too fast.

149
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,491
We'd write each other
with our dreams of the future.

150
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:59,793
I was gonna be
King of Cheeseburger Mountain.

151
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,595
(sighs)

152
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,297
Did I change or did they stop

153
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:05,699
making mountains
out of cheeseburgers?

154
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:08,468
Probably a little bit of both.

155
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:10,904
So sad.

156
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:15,642
(indistinct chatter)

157
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:17,744
(overlapping chatter)

158
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,613
What kind of moral example

159
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,382
is this dump for my boy?

160
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:23,750
(burps)

161
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:24,952
(crowd clamoring)

162
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,787
Please, calm down, everyone.

163
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,855
You know, maybe
this so-called cheating scandal

164
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,291
is actually
an opportunity to, uh...

165
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,127
(clears throat)
...initiate a-a dialogue

166
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,297
that would, uh, create
a teachable moment.

167
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,201
Uh, something, something
buzz word...

168
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:43,403
I got nothing.

169
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:45,372
Quick, get a picture
for the yearbook!

170
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:46,473
(crowd clamoring)

171
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,942
LISA:
I have a solution!

172
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:52,145
You took your sweet time
coming to our rescue, Lisa.

173
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,181
Maybe the best way to keep
students from cheating

174
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:56,650
is to trust them not to cheat.

175
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,285
(crowd murmuring)

176
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,653
That's it?
That's all you've got?

177
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,855
Something I can read
on a tea box?

178
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,525
What I'm suggesting is
we create an honor code.

179
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,961
Oh, swell, more work
for the teachers.

180
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,396
The students would do it.

181
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,897
Let her speak!

182
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:13,533
If every student pledges
not to cheat,

183
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:15,936
and to turn in any cheater,

184
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,504
no one will cheat the system

185
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,273
because they'll be the system.

186
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:23,877
ALL (chanting):
Honor code! Honor code!

187
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:25,946
I did it.

188
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,314
I saved the day.

189
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:29,683
The same way I won
that battle in Vietnam.

190
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,817
By fainting!

191
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:32,753
(doorbell rings)

192
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:35,188
If you're my wife's
secret lover, come in.

193
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,624
There's nothing
I can do for her anymore.

194
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:39,659
I am looking
for my <i>amigo de la pluma.</i>

195
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:41,261
Or "pen pal."

196
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:42,896
(gasps) Eduardo?

197
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,964
Is it really you?

198
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:45,532
Why are you here?

199
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,768
To save the soul
of Homer Simpson.

200
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:49,603
Now where is he, old man?

201
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,304
I'm Homer Simpson!

202
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:52,406
<i>Ay, dios mio!</i>

203
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,507
What has happened to you?

204
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,742
(speaking in Spanish)

205
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:57,577
Did your hair burn
off in a fire

206
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:58,912
that trapped you
in a candy factory?

207
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:00,881
I wish.

208
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,600
Marge Simpson.

209
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,002
It's so nice
to meet a friend

210
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:12,538
Homer met through the mail
who isn't a sea monkey.

211
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:14,573
Yes, Eduardo Barcelona.

212
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:17,042
Or in English, Eddie Miami.
Homie,

213
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:18,610
I thought a visit
from your old pen pal

214
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,045
would cheer you up.

215
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,214
Ah, how eagerly
I would wait for a letter

216
00:09:22,248 --> 00:09:25,551
from the <i>EstadosUnidos,</i>
and Homer Simpson.

217
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:29,187
HOMER:
"Buenos días, Eduardo."

218
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:32,291
HOMER (continues):

219
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:34,426
(chuckles)

220
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,762
What happened
to us, Eduardo?

221
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:39,631
We had so many things
we were going to do.

222
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,934
And I, my friend,
have been doing them.

223
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:43,168
Yeah, well, listen, pal.

224
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:44,836
I have my treasure--

225
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:46,838
my wife and my children.

226
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:48,607
Ooh!

227
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:49,641
I've had eight wives

228
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,276
and 200 children!

229
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:54,713
Among them artists, doctors
and revolutionary chefs.

230
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:56,315
Do you have a
disrespectful son

231
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:58,050
who calls you by
your first name?

232
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:00,285
I cannot imagine
such a creature.

233
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,087
Hey, Homer.
Did you just fart?

234
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:04,423
Did you
just fart, <i>sir.</i>

235
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:05,424
Whatever.

236
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,892
Easy, easy, Homer.

237
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:10,262
I want to help you fulfill
some of your childhood dreams.

238
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:11,930
Really? Now?

239
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:13,932
I have two pizzas coming.

240
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,968
I wanted to see who
would get here first.

241
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:17,102
Now, Homer!

242
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:18,270
Get your coat.

243
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:20,105
I asked him here
to cheer you up.

244
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,473
But I didn't think
you'd drop everything

245
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:22,975
to go gallivanting

246
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:25,444
with some, no offense, Spaniard.

247
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:27,913
I promise you
one thing, madam.

248
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:30,248
When I return your husband,
he will be happy,

249
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:33,452
bringing a new sense
of adventure to your marriage...

250
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:35,354
and to the bedroom.

251
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:37,856
(panting)
I'm not used to strange men

252
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,058
saying the word
"bedroom" around me.

253
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:42,294
Would you prefer, uh,
<i>"sala deamor"?</i>

254
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:43,929
That's even worse.

255
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:45,297
Could you say it
one more time?

256
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:46,431
<i>Sala de amor.</i>

257
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:49,134
(gasps) Ooh!

258
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:51,570
Hello, children.

259
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:53,605
I hold before you a copy

260
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,741
of the school's new honor code.

261
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:56,742
(all groaning)

262
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:57,843
I know if I can get

263
00:10:57,877 --> 00:11:00,012
the toughest kid in class
to sign it,

264
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:01,513
the rest of you will sign it.

265
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:02,581
Milhouse?

266
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,420
(grunts)
He's not the toughest kid, I am!

267
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:10,489
Mm-hmm!

268
00:11:10,523 --> 00:11:12,324
Now, the smartest kid.

269
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:13,959
Milhouse?

270
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:15,661
He's not the smartest kid.

271
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:18,630
I am.

272
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:21,500
Now the class nerd.

273
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:24,169
Milhouse?

274
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:26,204
(sighs): Oh.

275
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,775
(snickers)

276
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:33,245
Homer, are you prepared
to achieve the dreams

277
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,680
of a ten year old?

278
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:37,616
I took the liberty of crossing
off the, uh, stupid ones.

279
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:42,587
Now, this book
of your childhood drawings

280
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:44,089
will come to life.

281
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:46,191
Why are you doing this?

282
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:48,627
Wait, are you in love with me?

283
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:51,163
In love
with the concept of you, yes.

284
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:54,933
Woo-hoo! I'm an attractive
concept like Liberty!

285
00:11:57,837 --> 00:12:00,205
(siren wailing)

286
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,206
(tires screech)

287
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,974
One more ride?

288
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:04,509
All right.

289
00:12:04,544 --> 00:12:06,712
Don't forget to ring the bell.

290
00:12:06,746 --> 00:12:08,246
(bell ringing)

291
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:12,317
(laughing, grunting)

292
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:13,852
I'm sick of pirates

293
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:16,188
off the street ruining my play!

294
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:19,658
I'm going back to my old career!

295
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:21,093
Care to see a dessert menu?

296
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:24,029
We have the best cobbler
since Daniel Day-Lewis.

297
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,603
How much did this
cost to restage?

298
00:12:31,637 --> 00:12:34,873
They rented everything from
Comic Book Guy for ten bucks.

299
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:37,876
Don't stink up
the Gorn head.

300
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,746
I need it
for a Bar Mitzvah later.

301
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,047
(birds chirping)

302
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:44,416
Now don't forget,
this is the first exam

303
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,817
under the new honor code.

304
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,152
They're doing it.

305
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:48,453
They're self-proctoring.

306
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:50,789
Can't you say anything
in a normal way?

307
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:53,892
The answer, sadly,
is not yes.

308
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:55,227
(crickets trilling)

309
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,162
I don't know what it is

310
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:58,730
about having
all my dreams fulfilled,

311
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:00,632
but I feel great!

312
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,901
Oh, if you're
happy I'm happy.

313
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:03,902
What?

314
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:05,303
That doesn't sound happy.

315
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:07,639
I feel kind of, oh...

316
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:09,574
melancholy.

317
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:11,877
Mmm, melon collie.

318
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:13,512
(barking)

319
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:15,147
That's not helping.

320
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:17,549
Well, what was
your childhood dream?

321
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,184
Jumping on the bed.

322
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:21,219
But I never disobeyed
my parents.

323
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:22,387
Till I married you.

324
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:24,189
Let's do it.

325
00:13:24,223 --> 00:13:26,358
Oh, I'm a little tired.

326
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:28,126
Could we just snuggle again?

327
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:29,594
We do that every night!

328
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:30,629
Come on!

329
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:31,997
Jump on the bed!

330
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:36,168
(Homer giggling)
Ooh, okay!

331
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:38,103
(both laughing)

332
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:39,504
Can I help you, stranger?

333
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:41,640
I am just watching
my friend and his wife

334
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:44,342
innocently pleasure
themselves in bed.

335
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:45,510
That sounds salty,

336
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:47,078
but you seem sweet.

337
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:48,847
I'm gonna call you
Kettle Corn.

338
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,786
Eduardo, I haven't felt
this good in years.

339
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:56,822
You're like the Tooth Fairy.

340
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:59,524
Except you don't collect
human bones.

341
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:02,427
Yes, yes. Of course I don't.

342
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:03,628
Here.

343
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:04,729
So, that's it?

344
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:07,299
All my dreams, lived?

345
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,034
Eh... all but one.

346
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:10,168
Well, we've got to do it!

347
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:12,204
I never leave
a job unfinished.

348
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:13,972
It's as true now as that week

349
00:14:14,006 --> 00:14:15,740
I worked
on the high school yearbook.

350
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:17,209
So much infighting.

351
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:18,743
I had to get out of there.

352
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:21,546
All right, Homer,
we shall do this thing.

353
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:24,015
The editor put in
like six pictures of this girl

354
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,384
'cause she was his girlfriend.

355
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,119
Everyone has a
bad yearbook story.

356
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:29,187
They spelled my name wrong!

357
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:30,288
Get over it! Ha!

358
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:31,323
D'oh!

359
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:34,192
(propellers churning)

360
00:14:34,227 --> 00:14:36,127
So don't do what I did.

361
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:38,430
That concludes our safety video.

362
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,131
(grunts)

363
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,400
Just step out that door

364
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:44,336
and you can glide to earth

365
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,871
like your boyhood hero...

366
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:48,640
Rocky the Flying Squirrel.

367
00:14:49,842 --> 00:14:51,710
Uh, actually,
my hero

368
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:54,145
was the actress
who provided Rocky's voice,

369
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,947
June Foray.

370
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:58,350
A true legend
in the voice-over community.

371
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:00,252
I'm just gonna stay on the plane

372
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:01,853
and think about her influence.

373
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:03,221
She has lived her life.

374
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:04,689
Now, you must live yours.

375
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:05,724
No!

376
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:06,758
Do not worry!

377
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,627
I will follow
the trail of your fear!

378
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:09,661
(Homer yells)

379
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:11,162
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Will Homer make it?</i>

380
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:13,131
<i>Or will he leave</i>
<i>a crater the size</i>

381
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:15,367
<i>of the one</i>
<i>that destroyed the Yucatan?</i>

382
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:18,069
<i>Find out in our next</i>
<i>exciting installment:</i>

383
00:15:18,104 --> 00:15:19,404
Fat Splat...

384
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:21,907
<i>or</i> When You Squish
Upon a Car.

385
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,526
Mmm, it's amazing.

386
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,163
Every day has the peace
and serenity of a flu outbreak.

387
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,466
(laughs) Guess I'll be getting
some extra credit for this.

388
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,234
Lisa, I'm afraid you've gotten

389
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,636
all the extra credit
we can give out.

390
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,172
So Willie has been
growing you a nice pumpkin.

391
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,673
Here it is, lass.

392
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,843
You want me to carve it
into a thank-o'-lantern?

393
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,011
No, this is good.

394
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,983
Well, this knife's got
to carve something.

395
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,018
(menacing music playing)

396
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,288
(grunting)

397
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,289
Homer!

398
00:15:58,323 --> 00:15:59,957
(grunts thrice)

399
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,492
You don't have to flap.

400
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:03,594
Just glide on the wind.

401
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,730
Uh, okay.

402
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,698
Flap! Flap! Flap!
Flap! Flap! Flap!

403
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,101
(grunts twice)

404
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,870
Yes, good,
much better.

405
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,642
(groans)

406
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,678
I got Bart's backpack.

407
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,814
He got a hundred on his test?

408
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,850
That's impossible.

409
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,188
(gasps)
Is Bart cheating?

410
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,857
Are the Pope's tweets
infallible?

411
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,859
(laughs)

412
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,327
Bart, I'm gonna tell!

413
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,395
No, you're not.

414
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,163
Because if you tell people
I cheated,

415
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:40,664
that means your system failed.

416
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,933
Oh, my God,
you found a loophole!

417
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,237
Why don't you put this much
inventiveness into your work?

418
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,439
Because then I'd be the one
thing I swore I wouldn't.

419
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:49,607
You.

420
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,742
(whistling)

421
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,847
I'm doing it!

422
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,516
I'm flying like the squirrel

423
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,918
I always knew I was.

424
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,256
Ooh, indigo!

425
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,191
MARGE: Homer?
(yells gibberish)

426
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:09,593
It's me,
talking in your earphone.

427
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,262
Come down, Homie.

428
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,630
"You only live once"

429
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:16,267
also means when you die,
you die!

430
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,302
(cries out)

431
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:20,371
What's going on?

432
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:21,639
Hello?
(goose honks)

433
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:22,706
Hmm?
(honks)

434
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:23,707
Hmm? Hmm?
(honks)

435
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,109
Are you mocking me?

436
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:27,078
You can listen to your
wife when you are dead.

437
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,779
Savor the moment.

438
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,436
Majestic eagle.

439
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:56,307
Just like me,
unashamed of his baldness.

440
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,641
(eagle cries)

441
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,643
So beautiful.

442
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,412
Aw, he probably sees a mouse

443
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,147
he wants to tear in half.

444
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,148
(grunts)

445
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:05,583
D'oh!

446
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,652
Stupid tallest building
in Springfield!

447
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,688
(grunting)

448
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:16,894
Hmm...

449
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,028
(grunts)

450
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,064
(grunting)

451
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,135
Ha!
Whoa!

452
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,037
You've presented me
with quite a conundrum.

453
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,239
A word you should know

454
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,475
since it was on a
vocabulary test you aced.

455
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,710
(giggles)

456
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:36,547
But after some thought,
all my worries went away.

457
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:38,149
I know the answer.

458
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,485
I'm gonna force you
to turn yourself in.

459
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,586
Good luck with that.

460
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,821
The only thing that'll change
my mind

461
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,856
is a sign from God.

462
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:49,560
(Bart grunts)

463
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:52,396
Son, it was so beautiful!

464
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,699
I went faster
than the speed of sound.

465
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,735
(Homer yelling)

466
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,337
(grunts)

467
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,739
Well, Bart, is that enough

468
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,440
of a sign for you?

469
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,709
All right, I'll turn myself in.

470
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,444
It'll give me a chance
to work some more

471
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,213
on the detention quilt.

472
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,482
(humming a tune)

473
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:13,484
(all grunting)

474
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,486
This patch is
for all the victims

475
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,322
of atomic wedgies.

476
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,725
My friend,
you've lived your dreams.

477
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,628
No matter what,
Homer Simpson has done it.

478
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,965
And soon I hope I remember
who Homer Simpson is

479
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,167
and his relationship to me.

480
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,702
But I have no regrets.

481
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:35,072
In fact, all this
has given me a sense of calm

482
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:37,908
I've never had before.

483
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,410
That's the morphine.

484
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,912
Can you give me the
morphine forever?

485
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:42,913
No way!

486
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,281
A person on morphine
all the time

487
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,317
would constantly dissolve
in inappropriate laughter.

488
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,087
(laughs)

489
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:51,422
(sighs)

490
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:57,724
Eduardo? Eduardo! Eduardo!

491
00:19:57,758 --> 00:19:59,158
(grunts)

492
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:01,461
Oh.

493
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:03,596
It was all just a dream.

494
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,231
EDUARDO:
It was not just a dream.

495
00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:07,233
And you said you'd drive me
to the airport.

496
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:08,568
Oh, yeah.

497
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:09,669
Great.

498
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:11,137
Um...

499
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:12,372
Do I drop you at the curb

500
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:14,340
or do I have to park
and walk you in?

501
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,243
Go as far as your heart
will take you.

502
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:21,080
You are a good friend.
