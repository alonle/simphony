00:00:09,436 --> 00:00:10,569
Hm... hmm?!

3
00:00:10,603 --> 00:00:12,671
"Lisa wants

4
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:15,808
"a dot-dot-dot

5
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:16,909
guinea pig"?

6
00:00:16,943 --> 00:00:18,076
Mm.

7
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:33,058
Hey, Homer, did you know that
guinea pigs are self-groomers?

8
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:35,093
And when the get excited,
they jump straight up.

9
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:37,763
It's called "popcorning."
Lisa got to you.

10
00:00:37,797 --> 00:00:39,665
I don't know how,
but she got to you.

11
00:00:43,436 --> 00:00:44,937
Emojis.

12
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:47,272
Now she's gone too far.

13
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:50,542
Lisa, your father and I
are very concerned

14
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:52,478
about all this hinting.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,447
I've never had
a pet of my very own.

16
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:56,849
My clock is ticking.

17
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:58,417
I don't want to be
one of those girls

18
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:00,152
who waits till she's 16
to decide if she's ready,

19
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:02,020
and then it's too late.

20
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:04,423
Well, we've talked about it.

21
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:06,291
And if you really
want a guinea pig,

22
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:08,026
you'll have to sign
this contract.

23
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:11,797
"I, Lisa Simpson, hereby promise

24
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:14,132
to take full responsibility
for this dog, cat, other."

25
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:15,334
Circle "other."

26
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:17,369
"This includes
feeding, bathing,

27
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:19,071
"cleaning of droppings
and barfings,

28
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:22,941
and when the time comes,
burying or flushing."

29
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:24,710
Boilerplate,
boilerplate, boilerplate.

30
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:26,678
We can skip
all this litter box stuff.

31
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,280
"If pet
becomes Internet superstar,

32
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:29,748

33
00:01:29,782 --> 00:01:30,983
Sign here, here,

34
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:32,451
initial here, one
more over here.

35
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:33,886
And done.

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Oh, my God!

37
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:36,388
I'm getting a guinea pig!

38
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:37,389
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

39
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:38,457
thank you, thank you!

40
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:40,459
The kid-parent contract.

41
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:42,194
Unenforceable, yet you feel

42
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:45,264
like you didn't completely cave.

43

<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

44
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:58,410
You're doing the right thing
adopting a rescue pig.

45
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:00,345
You know, most of these guys
are rejects

46
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,348
from the big guinea-pig mills
in the Midwest.

47
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:05,684
Oh, I can't tell you
how many mill pigs

48
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:08,954
we get in here who have
bumblefoot or the slobbers.

49
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:11,356
You don't have
children, do you?

50
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:12,991
This one whistled at me!

51
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:15,060
Ooh, that could
be the one.

52
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:18,263
Oh, but that orange guy
looks like a pumpkin.

53
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:20,766
But this fellow is so fuzzy!

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,536
Well, they all have
their charms.

55
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:26,438
This one's nibbling
a sunflower seed.

56
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:27,706
Look at that hair.

57
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,641
Aw, I just want
to comb it forever!

58
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:32,144
Have you seen a pinker nose?

59
00:02:32,178 --> 00:02:34,146
I have now!

60
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,949
Lisa, you've just
got to choose <i>one.</i>

61
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,083
Lisa?

62
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,419
She's gone, honey.
She's gone.

63
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:42,521
That one's fur looks
like a tuxedo!

64
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:45,457
A Band-Aid on its tail, aw!

65
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:48,894
Albino!

66
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:50,529
I'm definitely
getting this one.

67
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:52,030
Oh, but I forgot
about this one.

68
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:54,299
Oh, my God,
I never even saw this one!

69
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:57,235
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh...

70
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,838
Maybe I should get
that sick one.

71
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:01,340
If I don't, no one else will.

72
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:04,042
Bart, list your top five,
best to worst.

73
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:05,510
No, no, no, no!
Worst to best.

74
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:08,780
I just wish the gray one had
the brown one's personality.

75
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,048
Okay, Dad, give me your phone.

76
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,249
I need to look
at the pictures again.

77
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:12,951
Aw, aw, aw!

78
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:15,320
Aw, aw!

79
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:18,357
Okay, this is the guinea pig

80
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:20,692
that will make me happy.

81
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:22,227
She thinks
she's decided.

82
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:23,662
Don't say a thing.

83
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:25,430
Don't blow this.

84
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:28,667
Okay, now, you sure
you only want just one?

85
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:31,436
They tend
to do better in pairs.

86
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:34,306
I could get two?

87
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:39,111
Farting tweakers rule!

88
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:41,279
I've tried to give Pokey
a perfect replica

89
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:43,081
of his natural habitat.

90
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:44,249
Peruvian feather grass,

91
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:45,717
an Incan sleeping mat,

92
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:47,319
and a portrait of
Marisol Espinoza,

93
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,287
the Vice President of Peru.

94
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:52,024
Are you sure you didn't create
a perfect habitat for you?

95
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:53,825
I wish I could
live in there.

96
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,260
Well, there's
plenty of room

97
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:57,129
because Pokey's gone.

98
00:03:57,163 --> 00:03:59,264
Where'd he go?

99
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:07,673
This looks like a job for...

100
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,708
fireplace tongs.

101
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:13,845
No!

102
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:20,519
Oh, my God!

103
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,187
He's in the walls!

104
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,356
I hear chewing.

105
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,958
No, that's a much bigger animal.

106
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:29,361
Kettle corn.

107
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:32,397
The heroin
of the farmers' market.

108
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:34,132
I've lost my guinea pig!

109
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,242
Pokey!

110
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:47,446
Our boat painting!

111
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,247
I'm sorry, Mom.

112
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,883
That's okay, sweetheart.

113
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,919
Your pig thingy
didn't mean it.

114
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:56,288
It's just, it felt
comforting to know

115
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:57,889
that while we watched TV,

116
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,559
there was art
going on behind us.

117
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:04,029
Oh, well, I guess we have to go

118
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:06,364
to an art gallery
and buy a new painting.

119
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,567
Sure, we could go
to a fancy gallery

120
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:11,236
and spend a bunch
of money, or...

121
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,857
Mm... hmm, hmm,
hmm, hmm?

122
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,859
Yeah, Milhouse played
the violin for years

123
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:17,576
until it turned out
the vibrations

124
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,444
were screwing up his bones.

125
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:22,047
Yeah, these seem great.

126
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,917
Oh, too bad someone
used cello rosin.

127
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:35,160
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful!

128
00:05:35,194 --> 00:05:38,263
I've never seen a painting
with a lighthouse before.

129
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,865
Oh, that.

130
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:42,067
That was on the wall
of Kirk's bachelor pad,

131
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:43,902
back when we were

132
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:45,303
separated.

133
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:46,905
Yeah, it's a great piece.

134
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,206
I didn't have a mirror,

135
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:49,441
so I shaved in the reflection

136
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,076
of the chrome frame.

137
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,178
This could be
our new living room painting.

138
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:54,846
I don't know.

139
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:55,847
How about this poster

140
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:57,482
of a really rocking jukebox?

141
00:05:57,517 --> 00:05:59,484
You know it's rocking
'cause music notes

142
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,819
are coming out of it.

143
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:02,554
Painting's only 20 bucks.

144
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:05,023
Oh, please, Homie?

145
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:07,225
I'll throw in
the tiny violins.

146
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:16,868
Oh, it looks great!

147
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:18,103
Well...

148
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:21,506
to me, it looks like...
garbage salad.

149
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,542
But that's
the great thing about art.

150
00:06:23,576 --> 00:06:27,379
Everyone can have their own
opinion about why it sucks.

151
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:29,548
I've got to get rid
of this ugly chrome frame

152
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:31,516
from Kirk's bachelor bad.

153
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:34,519
I hate to think of the things
this mirror has reflected.

154
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:36,955
Hmm!

155
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:38,456
Hey, look.

156
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:41,092
There's a signature
that the frame covered up.

157
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:44,262
"Johan Oldenveldt."

158
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:46,264
Here he is!

159
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:48,900
"Johan Oldenveldt, painter.

160
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:50,368
"Lived in Amsterdam, Paris.

161
00:06:50,403 --> 00:06:53,271
Prolific early 20th century
naturalist."

162
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:55,574
Ooh, I think this was painted
by someone famous.

163
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:57,275
Maybe it's valuable.

164
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,578
We should
have it appraised.

165
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:01,279
Pfft!
You guys are crazy.

166
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:02,848
I never even
heard of that guy.

167
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:04,049
It's not like
it was painted

168
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,418
by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.

169
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:08,954
Now, here's what
makes art valuable--

170
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:11,523
One: nudity,
two: holograms,

171
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,159
three: something terrible
happening to Jesus.

172
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:19,164
Ah yes, seascape,

173
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:20,832
marvelous natural light,

174
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:23,735
classic use of gouache.

175
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:24,936
You're right.

176
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:27,239
This is an early-career
Oldenveldt.

177
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:28,940
Quite valuable.

178
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:30,442
Oh, my God!

179
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:31,977
I expect it to go somewhere

180
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:34,746
between 80 to $100,000.

181
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,081
Nobody touch it!

182
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:37,415
Bart, stop looking at it!

183
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,650
But I want to see it!

184
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:40,485
No, you'll wear it out!

185
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,555
Baby, you saw something in this
painting, and you were right.

186
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,391
Wow, the Van Houtens
owned this for years,

187
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,027
and never knew
how much it was worth.

188
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:50,528
Think how happy they'll be

189
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:53,231
when we sell it and split
the money with them.

190
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,066
Split it? Whoa!

191
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:56,701
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

192
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:59,638
whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

193
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:01,973
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

194
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:03,275
whoa!

195
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:07,412
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

196
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,581
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

197
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,483
Oh!

198
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:18,526
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

199
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:20,710
Split it with them?

200
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:22,645
Kirk and Luann didn't
know what the painting

201
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,380
was worth when they sold it.

202
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:26,782
Yes, they sold it to us.

203
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:29,318
So, now it's our painting.

204
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:30,953
We can hang it on our wall,

205
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,989
cut eyeholes in it
to spy on people.

206
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,558
Or sell it for lots of money

207
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,393
which we keep.

208
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:38,861
For ourselves?

209
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:40,930
This dude gets it.

210
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:45,034
But the Van Houtens
are our friends.

211
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:46,435
Are they, Marge?

212
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,637
If you think about it,

213
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:48,938
aren't they really
just the parents

214
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:51,507
of a kid who happens
to hang out with our kid?

215
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,876
All our friends
are like that.

216
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:56,379
Well, how would you feel
if we sold them something

217
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:58,614
that turned out
to be valuable?

218
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,917
I would feel A) Happy
for their good fortune,

219
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:02,585
B) Proud to know rich people,

220
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,654
and C) Grateful
for an opportunity

221
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:06,689
to learn from a mistake.

222
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:08,424
<i>How about this?</i>

223
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,526
What if we give
the Van Houtens

224
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,528
25% of the money?

225
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:13,763
Then they'll just be mad

226
00:09:13,797 --> 00:09:16,999
about the 65%
that we're keeping.

227
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:19,702
Marge, you like
kindness, right?

228
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:20,836
Sure.

229
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:22,505
So, even if we gave

230
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,740
Kirk and Luann
some of the money,

231
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:28,711
the knowledge of what they could
have had will eat away at them,

232
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:31,981
like piranhas devouring
a wounded yeti.

233
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:35,151
It's kinder never to tell them.

234
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:36,919
Okay, I see your point.

235
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:39,155
We should sell the painting,
keep all the money,

236
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:42,124
and never, ever tell
the Van Houtens.

237
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,492
Mm-hmm!

238
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:52,735
What'll it take to
buy your silence?

239
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:53,803
Hmm.

240
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:55,104
<i>Okay, Milhouse,</i>

241
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,440
the guys in back are shining up
your new bike.

242
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:59,408
And all I have to do
is not say anything

243
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:01,877
about some painting
to my Mom and Dad?

244
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:05,781
Oh, sweetie, you want your
parents to be happy, don't you?

245
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:07,550
I guess.

246
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:09,752
"I guess"!

247
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:11,020
You're funny!

248
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:13,089
No wonder Lisa's
in love with you.

249
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:14,290
She is?!

250
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:15,992
She is?!

251
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:17,960
So, if I keep my mouth shut,

252
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:20,096
you get me new
wheelie sneakers,

253
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,098
and Bart agrees
to promote and encourage use

254
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:24,700
of my new
cool nickname, "C.J."

255
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,204
You got it, Ceej.

256
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,908
You found out that painting
was worth big bucks,

257
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:34,944
and you weren't
gonna tell us?!

258
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:37,580
I don't know
what you're talking about.

259
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:39,048
Hide the treasure!

260
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:40,516
I'm sorry, Mr. S.

261
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,751
I cracked!

262
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:43,019
We had a deal.

263
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:45,488
And now we've got nothing!

264
00:10:50,227 --> 00:10:52,128
We considered you
our friends.

265
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:53,529
We trusted you!

266
00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:55,731
I let Homer use
our master bathroom!

267
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,666
Then you stab us
in the back!

268
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:02,171
If you knew you sold
a valuable painting for nothing,

269
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,206
how could you live
with yourselves?

270
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:07,176
We were just trying
to be... kind.

271
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,012
Kind?! You call it kind
to give us nothing?

272
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:11,580
We were gonna treat you

273
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:13,115
to dinner
at an upscale chain restaurant

274
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,651
and never explain why,
but now forget it!

275
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:17,153
Oh, so that's how it is!

276
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:19,188
That's exactly
how it is.

277
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:20,589
Oh, is it?!

278
00:11:20,624 --> 00:11:22,525
Oh, it is!

279
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,728
Luann, I hope
we're still on Thursday

280
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:28,464
for collecting used
cell phones for the troops.

281
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:30,166
I don't think
you need any help.

282
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,601
You're so good at...
collecting.

283
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:35,004
Oh!

284
00:11:35,038 --> 00:11:38,874
Oh, that was cold,
Luann!

285
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:40,609
So cold!

286
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:42,645
Brr!

287
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,114
Sarcastic brr!

288
00:11:45,148 --> 00:11:47,783
See what happens
when we get greedy?

289
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:50,186
Honey, there's something
I want to show you.

290
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,687
An ATM receipt?

291
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:53,022
I don't know
whose this is.

292
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:54,957
I found it next
to the cash machine,

293
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:57,126
and I've always kept it.
Look at the balance.

294
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,161
Five figures!

295
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:02,598
With that painting, we could
have what these people have:

296
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:04,667
a money cushion.

297
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:07,136
No more living
paycheck to paycheck,

298
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,072
one lost retainer away
from the gutter.

299
00:12:10,107 --> 00:12:13,142
I could write a check
with today's date on it.

300
00:12:13,176 --> 00:12:15,244
That's the cushion.

301
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:19,949
Tonight, a special report.

302
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:21,750
Fat cat art experts
take advantage

303
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:23,919
of John and Jane Yard Sale.

304
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:26,055
So, would you characterize
your friend of many years

305
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,624
cheating you out of your
painting as no big deal,

306
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:30,226
or a devastating betrayal?

307
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,128
Oh, definitely betrayal, Kent.

308
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:33,662
Interesting.

309
00:12:33,697 --> 00:12:36,165
So if you see the Simpsons
walking down your street,

310
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:39,135
lock your doors and hide...
your friendship.

311
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:40,703
Great! Now we're raccoons,

312
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:43,139
the masked bandits
of the animal world!

313
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:46,709
Don't worry. No one's gonna see
this stupid show.

314
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:53,883
The whole town's
turned against us!

315
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:01,957
Ooh, a support rock!

316
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:04,793
This one's against us.
This one's for us.

317
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:07,897
For, for, against,
for, against...

318
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:10,599
We don't even get this many
Christmas cards.

319
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:18,440
There they are,
the Masterpiece Thievers!

320
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:19,942
Ah, shut your bone hole!

321
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:21,944
That painting belongs
to the Simpsons!

322
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:24,713
Sharing is what makes
a community strong!

323
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:26,248
All sales are final!

324
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:27,383
Keep it!

325
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:28,651
Finders keepers, moron!

326
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:31,487
You really think we're still
doing the right thing?

327
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:35,491
Just close your eyes
and think of the cushion.

328
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:42,565
"Untitled Landscape"
by Johan Oldenveldt,

329
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:45,334
from the Collection of Homer J.
and Marge B. Simpson.

330
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:48,204
Let's open the bidding
at $80,000.

331
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:53,108
The paddles, Marge!
Look at the paddles!

332
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,081
Stop the auction!

333
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:01,784
That painting belongs to me!

334
00:14:01,818 --> 00:14:03,052
Dawn?

335
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:06,188
Good to see you again,
Beef Kirky.

336
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:07,790
Who is this woman?

337
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:12,861
Uhhhhhh...

338
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:14,063
While you two
were separated,

339
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:16,465
Kirk and used
to be friends...

340
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:18,434
with banana-fits.

341
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:21,203
You told me
you didn't see anyone

342
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,705
during our separation.

343
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:28,077
Uhhhhhh...

344
00:14:28,111 --> 00:14:31,814
Madam, are you saying
this painting belongs to you?

345
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:33,415
Kirk stole it from me!

346
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,184
But I didn't know
it was valuable

347
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:37,219
till I saw the story on TV.

348
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:39,054
What?! I bought
that painting!

349
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:40,389
She's lying!

350
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:42,324
The auction is on hold

351
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:45,094
until we can determine
the true ownership.

352
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:47,963
Our cushion!

353
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:50,633
Don't bother
coming home, Kirk!

354
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:51,834
Aw!

355
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:53,002
See what your
greed has done?

356
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:54,003
Ow!

357
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:56,338
Anybody want
to give me a ride home?

358
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:57,740
Going once?

359
00:14:57,774 --> 00:14:58,941
Going twice?

360
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:01,143
Sold! To the lonely auctioneer!

361
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:03,345
Ah!

362
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:12,153
Thanks for
taking me in, man.

363
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:15,323
I guess I can't help but feel
fully responsible.

364
00:15:15,358 --> 00:15:19,127
Oh, Luann, I'll never gaze
from my thick eyeglasses

365
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:21,963
into your thick eyeglasses
ever again.

366
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:24,833
What you need, my friend,
is a Canadian Duff.

367
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,501
Beauty, eh?

368
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:30,505
So... why <i>does</i> that chick think
she owns the painting?

369
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,674
Oh, Dawn and I went
on a vacation

370
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,644
to a resort island
called Isla Verde.

371
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:37,278
I bought the painting
in a café,

372
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:41,182
but that night she ran off
with a parasailing instructor.

373
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:42,884
Not your fault, man.

374
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:46,121
Those parasailing guys take
whatever they want.

375
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,355
It was never her painting.

376
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,290
That woman will
say anything

377
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,826
to keep herself in
electric cigarettes.

378
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:54,462
And I'd go back to that
Café Artiste to prove it,

379
00:15:54,497 --> 00:15:57,866
but nothing's gonna
get me Luann back.

380
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:05,140
Okay, all I gotta do is take
a quick ferry to Isla Verde,

381
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,777
find Café Artiste,
and they'll back up Kirk's story.

382
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:12,080
That will prove the painting
was his-- and now ours.

383
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:15,950
Oh, Homer Simpson, that painting
has torn the town apart,

384
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:18,053
destroyed Kirk
and Luann's marriage,

385
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:21,356
and everyone's very worried
about Milhouse.

386
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,391
He's been playing
Dancing Revolution for hours,

387
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:25,226
but the TV is off.

388
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,765
But our cushion!

389
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,334
That picture has brought out
the worst in everyone!

390
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:37,539
Please! Just let it go!

391
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:42,077
You're not gonna
let it go, are you?

392
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:43,978
I wish I knew how.

393
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:48,083
This is so exciting!

394
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:50,218
My first time
establishing provenance!

395
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:51,786
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just remember,

396
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:55,890
if your mother asks,
I took you to a wine tasting.

397
00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:58,293
That's a terrible thing
for a father to do.

398
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:00,095
That's why
she'll believe it.

399
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:04,199
Hmm, this quaint artist
community

400
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,834
has gotten a little touristy.

401
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,776
Excuse me. We're trying
to find Café Artiste.

402
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,711
Ah, yes.
Top of the hill.

403
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:18,413
Three discos up, four
gelatos on the left.

404
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:20,148
You can't miss it.

405
00:17:20,182 --> 00:17:22,650
It's right between the disco
and the gelato place.

406
00:17:22,685 --> 00:17:23,985
Mmm. Hmm.

407
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:26,254
Mm-mm!

408
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:27,989
Mm...

409
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:29,257
Welcome to Café Artiste!

410
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,726
Would you like
a glass of Strupo?

411
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,762
It's a liqueur made
of fermented capers,

412
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:35,697
the official drink
of the island.

413
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:37,732
Mmm! Sounds delicious.

414
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,234
It's not.

415
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,904
Hey, a friend of mine,
uh, bought a painting here.

416
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:45,039
Oh, yes, I remember
that painting.

417
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:47,142
And that is the man
I sold it to.

418
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:49,978
And that man sold it to me!

419
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:51,713
That proves the
painting is mine!

420
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:53,948
And nothing can stop
me from selling it

421
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:56,384
and keeping all the money!

422
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,119
I love art!

423
00:17:58,154 --> 00:17:59,354
Art?

424
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:01,356
What do you know about art?

425
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,725
You don't even know
who painted that picture.

426
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,461
Yes, I do.
It's a Johan Oldenveldt.

427
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:08,863
Wrong! It's a me!

428
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:10,632
A what?
I painted it!

429
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,200
Me, Klaus Ziegler!

430
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,434
Who?

431
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:17,305
Mm!
Oh!

432
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:19,974
This is where I painted
your so-called Oldenveldt.

433
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:20,909
Prove it.

434
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:24,779
Aw, crap!

435
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:26,247
You're a forger?

436
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:29,184
"Forger" is such
a cruel word.

437
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:30,985
I'm an art forger.

438
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,488
Your painting was
an early, clumsy effort

439
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:36,991
which I gave to the café owner
to pay off my Strupo tab.

440
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:40,361
Whew!

441
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:42,864
Then why did the auction house
say it was real?

442
00:18:42,898 --> 00:18:45,200
I have fooled galleries
around the world

443
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:47,268
with my loving imitations.

444
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:50,038
Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler!

445
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:53,274
Ziegler!
Ziegler! Ziegler!

446
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:55,210
What you do is horrible...

447
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:57,412
ripping off geniuses
who spent years

448
00:18:57,446 --> 00:18:59,347
perfecting their styles.

449
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:01,482
Perhaps you are the one
who is horrible.

450
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:02,183
What?!

451
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:03,885
You only cared about that

452
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,986
painting when you thought

453
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,021
it was created
by someone famous.

454
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:12,827
Well, no, but <i>now</i> when I look
at it, all I see is a fraud.

455
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:14,562
Beauty is beauty.

456
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:18,399
My forgeries give pleasure to people
all over the world.

457
00:19:18,434 --> 00:19:21,369
<i>The only real question</i>
<i>to ask about art,</i>

458
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:22,670
<i>whether it's in the Louvre</i>

459
00:19:22,705 --> 00:19:25,673
<i>or on a freshman's wall</i>
<i>at Cal State Fullerton</i>

460
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,543
is, "Did it move you?"

461
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,278
But, you still, I mean...

462
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:33,348
Oh, I suppose you're right.

463
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,983
What if I never liked
the painting

464
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:36,351
and only wanted it for money?

465
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,086
Then you, I respect.

466
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:41,322
Oh, great.
The painting is worthless,

467
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:43,024
this was all for nothing,

468
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,693
and when Marge finds out,
she's gonna kill me.

469
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:49,297
Well, on that front,
perhaps I can be of assistance.

470
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:51,332
If there's one thing
art is good for,

471
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:55,570
it's to melt the frost which
often hardens a woman's heart.

472
00:19:55,604 --> 00:19:57,272
While you're at it...

473
00:19:57,306 --> 00:19:59,407
could you make me
a couple more?

474
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:01,442
I'll pay you in Strupo.

475
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,656
Perfect.

476
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,858
Oh, now that's art.

477
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:19,193
Rocking.

<i>The Gray Troll,</i>

480

<i>Brine of Madness,</i>
<i>Angel's Urine,</i>

481
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,816
<i>all names for the mysterious</i>

482
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,685
<i>Though this fermented caper</i>
<i>solution was originally used</i>

483
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,021
<i>to dissolve seagull corpses,</i>

484
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:54,590
<i>local alcoholics</i>
<i>soon found Strupo</i>

485
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,959
<i>to be a palatable drink</i>
<i>of last resort.</i>

486
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,294
<i>The noxious liqueur causes</i>

487
00:20:58,328 --> 00:21:00,863
<i>powerful olfactory</i>

488
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:04,300
<i>gender confusion,</i>
<i>and wandering mouth.</i>

489
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:07,537
<i>So if you visit Isla Verde,</i>

490
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:12,675
<i>be sure to say "ahoy" to the</i>
<i>crushing addiction of Strupo.</i>

491
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:15,278
<i>lose everything.</i>

492
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:34,246
Shh!
