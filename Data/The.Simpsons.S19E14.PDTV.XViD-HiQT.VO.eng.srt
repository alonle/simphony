00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:08,677
The Simpsons S19E14 (KABF07)
- Dial 'N' for Nerder -

2
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:32,511
Come and get me,
you syrupy stack of man-cakes.

3
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:41,259
It's too much work.

4
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,590
Why don't you come
and get me?

5
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:53,542
Jeez Louise,
are you okay?

6
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:54,905
Just give me a minute.

7
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:57,819
Uh, but feel free
to go nuts on me.

8
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,472
Oh, boy, dinner time!

9
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:08,670
The perfect break
between work and drunk.

10
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:12,230
Wait.
What's that smell?

11
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:14,369
It's like a stalk of broccoli

12
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:16,839
fell in a pot of boiling water.

13
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,255
It's your new diet!

14
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:23,270
But I have all those old diets
I still haven't finished.

15
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:26,831
Your lack of bedroom pizzazz
last night started me worrying,

16
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,730
so I hired this nutritionist,
Betsy Bidwell.

17
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:32,773
Homer, did you know I
used to weigh 400 pounds?

18
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:35,102
I'll bet no man
would touch you.

19
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:37,632
Well, I went from
fat to "all that"

20
00:01:37,637 --> 00:01:39,642
using my simple,
foolproof diet.

21
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:41,932
It's all about little
substitutions.

22
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,642
Instead of French toast
for breakfast,

23
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:45,033
why not eat a bell pepper?

24
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:46,542
When you crave something sugary,

25
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:47,633
eat a bell pepper.

26
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:48,463
Want a beer?

27
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:49,390
Bell pepper!

28
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:54,400
It's tangy like a pepper,

29
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:55,953
but crunchy like a bell!

30
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:57,003
Bell pepper!

31
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:59,983
Hot dogs!
Get your hot dogs.

32
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:01,101
One, please.

33
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:05,543
Bell peppers... piping cold,
crunchy and bland.

34
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:06,543
Three, please.

35
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:34,481
Not quite.

36
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:36,530
Yeah. Get out.

37
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:44,691
You've gained seven pounds!

38
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:47,251
Well, they say muscle
weighse than fat.

39
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,612
Homer,
your body is all fat.

40
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:52,581
Homie, have you been
cheating on your diet?!

41
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:53,533
What?!

42
00:02:53,536 --> 00:02:56,790
I'm not even gonna dignify
that with eye contact.

43
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:09,502
What you doin', Mom,
goin' crazy?

44
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:11,081
Searching for evidence.

45
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,972
I know your father's
cheating on his diet.

46
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:15,220
Hey, Marge, looking
for something?

47
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:16,791
I'm looking for something,
too...

48
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,601
a bell pepper I don't like.

49
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:21,080
Maybe it'll be this one.

50
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,332
Wrong again.

51
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,893
See that fat lady with
the moustache?

52
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:31,510
That's you.

53
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:33,241
See that hippo rolling in dung?

54
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,250
You're the dung.

55
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,841
Now, that's enough.
You each got one in.

56
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:38,662
Oh, but hers was better!

57
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,242
Meet Jennifer.

58
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:44,842
She's worried her
acupuncturist boyfriend

59
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:47,200
is sticking it to someone else.

60
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,412
He used to be so loving.

61
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:51,770
Now he says
he's always working late,

62
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:54,451
but when he comes home,
his needles aren't even bloody!

63
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,412
I've tried everything
except talking to him.

64
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,281
Help me, TV show!

65
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:01,541
We'll find out
if Jennifer's boyfriend

66
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:04,550
has been fooling around
on Sneakers.

67
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:07,063
If you suspect a loved one
of cheating on you,

68
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:08,400
call the Sneakers hotline.

69
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:09,953
Also call if you don't suspect.

70
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:12,860
Most cheating happens when
you think everything is just great.

71
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:16,802
Hmm. Could this show help
me with eating cheating?

72
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,090
Out of the house, kids!

73
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:20,152
I have to make an
adult phone call.

74
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:21,783
- Oh, man,not again...
- How would you...? Come on.

75
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:23,562
Go, go, go, go, go!

76
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:27,630
Springfields national park
Now smaller than ever

77
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:30,761
Hey, I didn't know
this park was here.

78
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:32,822
You wrote a report
on it last week.

79
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:33,920
The Internet wrote it.

80
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:35,282
I just handed it in.

81
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,801
Whoa, check that out!

82
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:41,171
Cool! The strong kicking
the weak's butt.

83
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,981
It's disgusting!

84
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,960
Now you two play nice!

85
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:55,132
This is my husband.

86
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:58,201
I think he's been
sneakering on his diet.

87
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,123
I didn't used to mind it

88
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:02,930
when he'd lock the bathroom
door and snack off,

89
00:05:02,938 --> 00:05:04,801
but when he's getting it regular,

90
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:07,730
night after night after night...

91
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:10,061
There, there.

92
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:12,142
I'm sorry I'm so emotional.

93
00:05:12,156 --> 00:05:15,242
No, I mean,
cry to the camera over there.

94
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,470
There.

95
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:18,993
Yeah!

96
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:23,161
Hey, Martin,
what are you doing?

97
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:25,261
Excavating for arrowheads!

98
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:26,711
Dude, it's Saturday.

99
00:05:26,716 --> 00:05:28,952
- What kindof a freak wastes his...?
- May I join you?

100
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,513
Care to make ita trio, Bart?

101
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:32,532
You can brush,
and I can blow!

102
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:34,500
Well, I agree you blow.

103
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:35,831
Then it's a plan.

104
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:38,570
A lot of people blow,
but no one blows like you.

105
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:40,160
High praiseindeed!

106
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:41,663
When you look up blow
in the dictionary...

107
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,071
- Bart, he's not gonna get it!
- Fine.

108
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:56,501
The bone's the very thing,
methinks,

109
00:05:56,508 --> 00:05:59,123
to prank my sister
and the dink.

110
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,542
Martin, I've made
a major discovery!

111
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:10,482
A bone?!

112
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,080
It could be one
of the major homos!

113
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:15,181
- You're one oft he major...
- Forget it.

114
00:06:28,128 --> 00:06:30,043
- Martin!
- Oh, my God!

115
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:33,602
Grab on to this!

116
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:37,203
Come on, wake up!

117
00:06:46,116 --> 00:06:46,831
Bart!

118
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:49,032
You can't just run
away from this!

119
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:51,251
You're right.

120
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:52,840
I can bike away much faster,

121
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:55,081
and ring the bell
to drown out bad thoughts!

122
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:58,903
But Bart...

123
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:07,001
Bart, Martin could be
seriously hurt, or worse.

124
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:08,802
You're right.
We have to do something.

125
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:09,882
Let's watch TV!

126
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:14,653
<i>Happy, happy safe at home</i>

127
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:16,192
<i>Happy, happy...</i>

128
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:18,990
We interrupt
Kaptain Kiddy's Komfort Karnival

129
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,900
to report on a grisly incident
involving a small child,

130
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,422
who has apparently
plunged off a guardrail here

131
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:25,971
at Springfield National Park.

132
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,051
According to this pocket protector,

133
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:30,802
the victim's name is
Martin Prince.

134
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:34,071
Sadly, his pocket was protected,
but nothing else.

135
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:36,771
And we know exactly
who is to blame.

136
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:38,201
No one.

137
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,123
The boy clearly fell by accident.

138
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:40,911
Huh?

139
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:43,430
He crashed through
the tree canopy there,

140
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:46,252
and was presumably eaten
by this cougar,

141
00:07:46,255 --> 00:07:49,581
who is still coughing up
parts of the boy's clothes.

142
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,470
Tragic, just tragic.

143
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:54,440
You think this would fit
little Ralphy?

144
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:55,739
Chief, that's evidence.

145
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:57,549
I know,
but after it's evidence,

146
00:07:57,548 --> 00:07:59,045
it's a shirt again, isn't it?

147
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:01,731
So Chief, what's your final word
on the Prince boy?

148
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:03,463
Hmm? Oh, dead.
Definitely dead.

149
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:05,752
Uh, Chief, aren't
we supposed to, uh,

150
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,203
notify the mily first?

151
00:08:07,215 --> 00:08:08,942
What do you think
I'm doing right now?

152
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,810
<i>Happy, happy, safe at home.</i>

153
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:14,860
- Oh, my God!
- We're murderers!

154
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:16,802
Hey, I was trying to help him.

155
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,913
At worst, I'm an accomplice.

156
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,521
I'm an accomplice!

157
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:31,102
Bookmobile.

158
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:33,062
Got any Joyce Carol Oates?

159
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:35,173
Nope.
It's allDanielle Steel.

160
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:39,582
I've been in trouble,
but never like this.

161
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:41,971
Guess I'll go turn myself in.

162
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,440
Uh, let's think about this.

163
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:51,153
Martin's gone,
but it was an accident.

164
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,580
Ruining our lives
won't bring him back.

165
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:54,530
Lisa!

166
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,531
You're saying
we shouldn't tell the truth?!

167
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,513
I'm saying this is worse than
a million A minuses!

168
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:01,371
So, how was your outside time?

169
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,153
We were never outside.
We were here all day.

170
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:06,001
That quick talking
is never a good sign.

171
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:07,992
That's usually true,
but in this case, it's not.

172
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:11,521
Hmm. The kids are
acting awfully strange.

173
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:14,183
Maybe I should sit down
with them and...

174
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,223
- Homer, where are you going?!
- Work.

175
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:18,762
It's 4:00 o'clock
on a Saturday.

176
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,183
I, uh,...

177
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,113
have to count the atoms
at the nuclear plant.

178
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:25,452
Conservation of mass.
It's the law.

179
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:33,112
The load is on the road.

180
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,663
This episode's gonna be great.

181
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:41,352
It'll finally win me
the respect of my father,

182
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:43,722
the Reverend Billy Graham, Junior.

183
00:09:58,537 --> 00:10:00,430
Martin Prince was known

184
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:01,750
by many names...

185
00:10:01,755 --> 00:10:04,982
Martin Priss, Martin Princess,
Fartin' Prince,

186
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:06,893
Martin the Brown-Nosed Reindeer...

187
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,960
That was mine.

188
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:10,041
Martin was a shy, awkward child

189
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:12,823
who will never fulfill his
promise to become

190
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:14,610
a weird, unloved adult.

191
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,682
The Audio-Visual Club
has prepared a video tribute

192
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:19,480
to their fallen associate.

193
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:34,200
<i>I will remember you</i>

194
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:41,101
<i>Will you remember me?</i>

195
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:46,381
<i>Don't let your life pass you by</i>

196
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:48,850
Jimbo, stop that.

197
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:49,930
Usually when I do

198
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:51,661
something bad, I feel good.

199
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:52,972
But not this time.

200
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:56,190
Martin was like Jesus, only real.

201
00:10:56,437 --> 00:11:00,093
Bart, keep it together.
People are looking.

202
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:01,572
I'm filled with rue.

203
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:04,020
You know,
something bugs me.

204
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:06,222
Martin was afraid of heights.

205
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:07,862
What's he doing on a cliff?

206
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:09,053
It don't add up.

207
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:11,410
Hey, look who's trying to add.

208
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:12,902
You wuss.

209
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:26,212
The pig is in the sty.

210
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:29,980
You know, I used to make
documentaries about

211
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:33,022
coal miners, migrant workers,
things that mattered.

212
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,520
Yeah yeah, we're all whores.
Just get in there.

213
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:52,163
Into your hands,
I commend this crap.

214
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:06,742
Well, enough burning ants.

215
00:12:06,745 --> 00:12:08,530
Time to investigate.

216
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:28,152
I now declare you
chips and salsa.

217
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:34,672
Oh, hey, kids.

218
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:36,900
Um... what's up?

219
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:37,913
What do you mean "what's up"?

220
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:39,053
Why would something be up?

221
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:40,552
Yeah, nothing's up,
nothing's down,

222
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,241
except for Martin, who died.

223
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,031
- Idiot!
- D'oh!

224
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:48,851
Well, I certainly wasn't eating

225
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:51,150
chips and salsa
from this briefcase.

226
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:53,411
- What's up?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

227
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:29,043
Mmm, lamb.

228
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:53,642
Uh, I've never said this before,
but turn the camera off.

229
00:13:57,616 --> 00:14:00,752
- Hey, you little murderer.
- What?!

230
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,461
Those shades are killing me,

231
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,431
they're so cute.

232
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,572
Act like you're shopping.

233
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:10,250
We can't be seen together.

234
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:12,942
- But we're brother and sister.
- Exactly.

235
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:14,550
- Give me an lndian burn.
- But...

236
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:16,521
Don't make me say
"Indian" again.

237
00:14:18,345 --> 00:14:19,733
Afternoon.

238
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:21,962
Doing a little shopping, huh?

239
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,693
Shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart.

240
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:26,933
I like how "Kwik" is spelled
with a "K."

241
00:14:26,936 --> 00:14:28,790
It's a quicker way
of spelling "quick. "

242
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:30,723
Well, you're busy people.

243
00:14:30,728 --> 00:14:32,570
I'll let you get on
with your day.

244
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:35,840
Oh, there is
one other thing.

245
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:38,313
I was up in
Springfield National Park.

246
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:40,560
You know,
where Martin bit the big one?

247
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:43,370
Found this bone tied
to a string.

248
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:47,013
Almost like someone
was playing a prank on him.

249
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:49,192
You like pranks,
don't you, dingus?

250
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:50,421
I... like pranks.

251
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:52,913
Everyone likes pranks,
e- even Dr. Hibbert.

252
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:54,132
I hate pranks.

253
00:14:54,137 --> 00:14:55,963
Well, better get going.

254
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:57,972
The missus is cooking
meat loaf tonight.

255
00:14:57,975 --> 00:14:59,860
My mom... Mrs. Muntz.

256
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,140
Bart, I have a plan.

257
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:08,412
We go to the morgue and
come back with a hand,

258
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,963
put its fingerprints
all over the railing...

259
00:15:11,768 --> 00:15:13,690
Why are you being
so quiet, Bart?

260
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:15,250
Are you judging me?

261
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:17,123
Please don't judge me.

262
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:20,861
"I can't live with the guilt.

263
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:22,883
I'm going to Martin's house

264
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,782
to end it all"?!

265
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:30,032
Come on, pick up, pick up,

266
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:31,360
I know you're there.

267
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:36,242
Listen, baby,
the other night was great,

268
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:38,003
but it can never happen again.

269
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:39,042
Oh, who am I kidding?

270
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:40,321
I have to see you right now.

271
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:54,202
Bart, no, don't do...

272
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:56,753
whatever the heck
you're doing.

273
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:59,101
I'm tending to Martin's
butterfly enclosure.

274
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:01,721
His butterflies are emerging
from their chrysalises tonight.

275
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,903
You said you wanted
to end it all.

276
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:05,603
By which I meant bring Martin's

277
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:07,363
butterfly project to completion.

278
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:08,570
I can't take it anymore.

279
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:09,832
The stress is killing me.

280
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,040
I'm on a freight train
to Crazy Town.

281
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:14,293
- Çalm down.
- You calm down!

282
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,843
What was that?

283
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:23,012
The butterflies are hatching.

284
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,633
Aren't they beautiful?

285
00:16:25,637 --> 00:16:28,223
<i>Greetings, my friends.</i>

286
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:31,060
<i>This beguiling lute solo</i>

287
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:34,351
<i>will ease your metamorphoses.</i>

288
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,532
Oh, it's a tape.

289
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,450
Martin must have set it to go off

290
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:42,042
when the chrysalises hatched.

291
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:45,140
Now, if I may mimic
your mother's feeding call...

292
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:46,961
Clawdy-claw,

293
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,660
clickety-cloo, clawdy-claw...

294
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:50,800
Thank you.

295
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:55,682
I thought I turned
that tape off.

296
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:58,502
Maybe you just put
it on auto-reverse.

297
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:01,621
"Congratulations on purchasing
the Sanyo DL30,

298
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:04,342
the finest non-reversing
tape player"...

299
00:17:11,246 --> 00:17:14,452
Here you go, hon-
one Butterscotch Stallion.

300
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:16,840
Homer Jay Simpson!

301
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:18,581
Pudding power, activate!

302
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:20,430
Oh, no, you don't.

303
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,350
Let him have it, Marge.

304
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:24,430
Sweetheart, I didn't want
to deceive you.

305
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:26,103
I just couldn't stand to see

306
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,410
the disappointment
in your beautiful eyes.

307
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,280
That's it, Marge.
Slap him good.

308
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,593
Zack, you're not trying
to help our marriage.

309
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:39,811
You're trying to split us up.

310
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:43,612
I'd rather have a chubby
hubby than a sexy exy.

311
00:17:43,616 --> 00:17:46,311
Aw, Marge, if there was
a reality show

312
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:49,071
called Fat Guys Who Really
Love Their Wives,

313
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:52,132
that not only would it be an
enormous ratings success,

314
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,370
but I'd be the first one on it.

315
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:58,152
Marge, you've given me a lot

316
00:17:58,157 --> 00:17:59,271
to think about today.

317
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:00,702
Now, if you'll excuse me,

318
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,083
I'm going to the editing room

319
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,212
to make you look insane.

320
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,803
To the post-production trailer!

321
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:15,752
Where is this music coming from?

322
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:25,371
Get off me!

323
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:31,882
His foot is caught
in my button hole.

324
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:34,433
I almost flicked
an innocent butterfly.

325
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:37,523
Bart, we're turning
into monsters.

326
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:39,920
- Cool.
- No, not cool.

327
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:42,902
We have to do the right thing
and come clean.

328
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:47,012
Listen, world,
we killed Martin Prince!

329
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:49,802
That's all I needed to hear.

330
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:51,262
You almost got away with it,

331
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:52,922
but here's where you got sloppy:

332
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:54,910
shouting out that you did it.

333
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,713
Oh, man, I'm too pretty
to go to jail.

334
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:59,840
You don't know
how lucky you are.

335
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,042
I'm just glad it was you

336
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:04,800
who brought us in, Nelson.

337
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:06,713
Remember when
we used to date?

338
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:07,723
If you let me go,

339
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:09,190
we can get back together.

340
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:10,900
I never let you cherry-bomb

341
00:19:10,907 --> 00:19:11,913
my Malibu Stacy.

342
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,231
I'll let you do it now.

343
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,560
Save it for the warden.

344
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,160
Please, keep it down

345
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:17,761
around the newborns.

346
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:21,332
To quote Mark Twain,
"rumors of my death

347
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,620
have been greatly exaggerated. "

348
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:25,642
Yeah, and rumors
of your wussiness

349
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:27,170
are a hundred percent true.

350
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:28,843
Now tell us how
you survived the fall.

351
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,553
For years I've worn underwear

352
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:32,832
with a wedgie-accommodating
waistband.

353
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:34,751
On that fateful day,

354
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,213
these mighty whiteys
saved my life.

355
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:44,643
<i>Malheureusement, I landed</i>

356
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,122
<i>right next to a cougar's lair.</i>

357
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:48,992
<i>He saw me as easy prey.</i>

358
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:52,281
<i>I feared death was a certainty</i>

359
00:19:52,286 --> 00:19:53,860
<i>until I was saved</i>

360
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,293
<i>by simple physics.</i>

361
00:19:58,926 --> 00:20:00,410
<i>I landed on a small isle</i>

362
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,072
<i>in the middle of a murky lake.</i>

363
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,712
<i>I spent an hour fashioning
an escape raft</i>

364
00:20:04,716 --> 00:20:06,871
<i>and three days crafting</i>

365
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,442
<i>this modesty skirt.</i>

366
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,182
Well, it's good to have

367
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:14,542
you alive, Dorkburger,

368
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:15,901
and as for you two,

369
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:17,150
I hope you learned your lesson.

370
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:19,611
I learned that beneath
my goody two-shoes

371
00:20:19,616 --> 00:20:22,310
lie some very dark socks.

372
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:24,512
And I learned that killing a nerd

373
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,310
is not as fun as it sounds.

374
00:20:27,697 --> 00:20:31,141
There is just one more thing.

375
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:33,290
You folks have
a good night now.
