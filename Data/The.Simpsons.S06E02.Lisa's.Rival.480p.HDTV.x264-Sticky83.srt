1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,340
25 cars line up to start
the last Grand Prix

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,980
of the most extraordinary season
in the history of Formula One.

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,220
'This, then, is the clincher -

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,420
'the World Championship decider.'

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,540
As heavy rain pours down,
two drivers prepare for the race
that will decide

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,980
which one of them
becomes World Champion.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,740
'James Hunt in his McLaren.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,260
'Niki Lauda in the Ferrari.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,300
'The flag is down...'

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,500
The two men could not be more
different. Britain's James Hunt

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,100
is a fast, flamboyant showman
who parties as hard as he races.

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,140
James is the driver of the old time.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,540
The gentleman driver,
the flamboyant...

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,700
That has the natural talent to go
fast in a car.

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,220
There is a race going on, dear boy.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,660
His rival is the steely Austrian
Niki Lauda who drives

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,700
with cold, hard logic.

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,380
Niki was the scientist,
the counterpoint -

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,860
he was the ultimate... The first
really technical driver.

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:18,820
This is the story of Formula One's
legendary rivalry - told by those
who witnessed it first hand.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,860
James got out of the car,
pulled off his crash helmet,

22
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,500
started to rant and rave at them...

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,540
'And Brambilla spins!'

24
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,140
The tension was just amazing.

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,740
His face was a mask of blood
and I was saying, "My God,
how can he race?"

26
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,060
With previously unseen footage
and exclusive interviews,

27
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,860
this film charts the epic duel that
would change the lives of both men
and the sport forever.

28
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,620
You couldn't make it up.
You could not make up this season.

29
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,100
It was just unbelievable.

30
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,460
'It's going to be a fantastic race.'

31
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,900
Fans line the streets to see
Austrian Niki Lauda crowned

32
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,300
World Champion of 1975.

33
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,740
Lauda drives for Ferrari -

34
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,260
the greatest racing car
constructor in the world.

35
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,140
But Lauda's thoughts

36
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,940
and those of his team are already
turning to next season.

37
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,340
Ferrari's team manager

38
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,060
Daniele Audetto is confident that
Lauda will retain his crown in 1976.

39
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,820
Niki Lauda was a very
professional driver.

40
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,300
He can see the strategy,

41
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,980
he can really understand when was
the moment to push a little more,

42
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,060
a little bit less,
and was extremely fast

43
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,660
and so consistent.

44
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,980
But in Britain
a new challenger has emerged.

45
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,700
Ladies and gentlemen, James Hunt.

46
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,620
APPLAUSE

47
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,700
James Hunt has signed for British
team McLaren -

48
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,340
Ferrari's arch rivals,

49
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,980
but he has yet to prove
he is championship material.

50
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,420
British drivers and British cars,
for that matter,

51
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,660
have dominated Grand Prix racing

52
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,380
and our domination had
dropped off a little bit now

53
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,500
and I just feel very ambitious
to take up the cudgels.

54
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,940
I think James was hugely popular

55
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,020
because he was an attractive
character.

56
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,500
He was a Brit
and loved in this country already.

57
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,340
But I don't think people thought
he had anything like

58
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,900
the chance that Niki Lauda had.

59
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,300
Hunt is better known for his
romantic exploits than his driving.

60
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,940
I once talked to Jackie Stewart
who had this thing about the car

61
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,580
being a woman.

62
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,020
And you drove the car like you
made love to a woman.

63
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,660
Do you have
the same poetic turn...?

64
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,700
I'd sooner stick to the women.

65
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,460
LAUGHTER

66
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,100
With his last team,
his cavalier style had earned him
the nickname "Hunt the Shunt".

67
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,860
Now, McLaren team manager
Alastair Caldwell

68
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,700
has reservations about Hunt
joining the team.

69
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,780
The '76 season got off to
a very interesting start for us.

70
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,540
James didn't have a drive
and we didn't have a driver,

71
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,660
so we were thrown into bed with him.

72
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,100
He rang me up and said,

73
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,740
"I think I'm your new driver."
I said, "I guess you are."

74
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,780
One of the first things
you noticed is

75
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,220
when the car was
switched off on the grid,

76
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,060
he was so wound up,
the whole car was shaking

77
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,500
with his nervous energy.

78
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,460
He had a lot of adrenaline in him,
that's for sure.

79
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,820
But that's one of the reasons
he was a good racing driver.

80
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,220
He was always competitive.

81
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,260
And always very focused on something
he wanted to do,

82
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,500
be it budgerigars as a teenager,

83
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,780
or train sets or Scalextric

84
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,420
or something as a small boy.

85
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,860
James was a sportsman,
through and through.

86
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,900
He never played team games,
his sports

87
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,700
were all solitary.

88
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,660
He was very single-minded
and he knew what he wanted.

89
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,580
He wanted to be World Champion.

90
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,460
The 1976 season will
consist of 16 races over 10 months,

91
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,460
running from January to October
at locations across the world.

92
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,460
It is not just Lauda
and Hunt that are in competition -

93
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,060
15 different teams,
each with two drivers,

94
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,380
are in the fight for the title.

95
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,180
But Ferrari and McLaren
are the leading contenders.

96
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,660
Ferrari were my arch enemies.

97
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,100
Daniele Audetto
was their team manager,

98
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,740
so I was at war with them.

99
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,180
Ferrari has a history

100
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,420
much bigger,
much longer than McLaren.

101
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,540
We couldn't compete with them
on money

102
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,660
but we could compete with them
in style and in efficiency.

103
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,820
They're a lot bigger team

104
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,460
and incredibly Italian.

105
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,780
I think we respect each other
professionally

106
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,660
but I don't have a beer with him
in the pub,

107
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,460
if you want an example.

108
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,580
Race one is in the scorching heat
of the Interlargos circuit
in Brazil.

109
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,100
Each race will cover
a distance of 200 miles in
approximately two hours but first,

110
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:42,820
each driver races against the clock
to set the best possible lap time.

111
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,420
The driver with the best
time will be rewarded with

112
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,700
first place on the starting line.
Pole position.

113
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,980
In the thick of the action is pit
lane reporter, Peter Windsor.

114
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,620
In the distance,
you'd hear an engine note,

115
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,300
and four minutes later,
the car would reach you

116
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,620
and all four
wheels would be off the ground.

117
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,980
And you'd think,
"Wow, this is Formula One."

118
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,780
The news on the track in Brazil is
that Hunt is fast.

119
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,700
To everyone's amazement
he makes the best lap time

120
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,300
and gains his first-ever
pole position.

121
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,460
What I remember most is Niki Lauda

122
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,300
looking up the pit lane and thinking,
"What's going on here?"

123
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,620
Because nobody really knew,
including Niki,

124
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,940
how good he would be.

125
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,540
Do you just want to get a level?

126
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,980
If I say "shucks" and BLEEP
and all that sort of stuff...

127
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,820
Oh, dear. I'll cancel it, then.
Can we rub that out?

128
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,300
He might have had some good lines

129
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
for the microphones,
he might have had

130
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,740
a roving eye for the girls,

131
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,700
but in the cockpit,
he was very serious.

132
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,380
Hunt takes his place at the front
of the starting grid,
just ahead of Lauda.

133
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,460
The World Champion's car carries
the coveted number one,

134
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,100
but all eyes are on the Hunt
in car number 11.

135
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,940
Lauda gets the best start, with
Hunt's McLaren chasing hard behind.

136
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,780
Sadly, in the race, part of the fuel
system or the engine fell off,

137
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,020
so he flew off the road,

138
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,780
which wasn't his fault.

139
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,860
So it wasn't a fairy-tale beginning,

140
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,060
but everybody left Brazil
very pleased

141
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,820
that James was obviously quick.

142
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,580
Lauda has seen off Hunt's challenge

143
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,340
and collects nine points to start
building his score.

144
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,380
The points scoring system was
disarmingly simple.

145
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,860
Nine points for a win, six for
second, four for third,

146
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,700
down to sixth place where you
got one point.

147
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,820
We didn't know it would become
so complicated.

148
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,500
In an age when Concorde is
taking its first passenger flight

149
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,580
and synth music is capturing
the imagination, Lauda's highly

150
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,420
technical approach perfectly suits
a time falling in love with
technology.

151
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,220
MUSIC: "Autobahn" by Kraftwerk

152
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,820
Lauda is a complete driver -
preparing his Ferrari

153
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,380
meticulously before every race.

154
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,100
He could stay in the garage

155
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,820
until maybe eight
o'clock in the evening

156
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,380
to stay with the mechanic,

157
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,420
to make sure he does the job
properly

158
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,460
and to understand what
they are doing.

159
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,300
Because Niki is a perfectionist.

160
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,180
What he's doing,
he want to do it to his best.

161
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,940
At Lauda's side is his wife,
Marlene.

162
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,540
Marlene was a fantastic young lady.

163
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,100
She was a beautiful lady,

164
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,780
but for Niki she was also a big
moral supporter,

165
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,900
and I think was a big
part of his success.

166
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,940
Lauda knows how to get the best
out of his team.

167
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,180
Niki Lauda had really learned

168
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,220
how to make Ferrari work for him.

169
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,260
An awful lot of very good drivers

170
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,300
went to Ferrari
and never quite made it work.

171
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,340
It had a terrifying presence

172
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,660
of Enzo Ferrari,
with his dark glasses,

173
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,820
looming over the whole thing.

174
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,060
Incidere senz'altro, perche...

175
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,900
After nearly five decades
in motor racing, the 78-year-old

176
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,420
Enzo Ferrari rules his family
business with an iron fist.

177
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,860
Mr Ferrari lost his temper and say,

178
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,860
"I am the boss here,
you have to do what I want."

179
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,140
He did have his favourites

180
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,820
and Niki, clearly,

181
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,060
had got close to Enzo
Ferrari in that way,

182
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,300
and I think the bottom line is Enzo
Ferrari liked to win.

183
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,540
He loved winners.

184
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,340
He cared about the results.

185
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,060
And Lauda delivers, pulling further

186
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,300
and further ahead of Hunt
with every race,

187
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,500
but at the fourth round in Spain,
Lauda has worrying news for Audetto.

188
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,780
"Daniele, I have a problem."
"What happened?"

189
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,860
"I fell off from my tractor

190
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,540
"in my house, in my garden

191
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,620
"and I broke two or three ribs."

192
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,100
I said, "My God -
two or three ribs?!"

193
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,420
He had a gardening accident,
I think.

194
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,860
I think he was mowing his lawn
in Austria with a garden tractor

195
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,460
and it rolled on him, which is

196
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,620
quite a common occurrence
with garden tractors.

197
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,100
James had this approach to it all,
which was,

198
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,820
"He's no problem.
Halfway through the race, his ribs

199
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,140
"will give up and I'll pass him and
win the race." It's exactly what
happened!

200
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,180
# There was something
in the air that night

201
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,820
# The stars were bright
Fernando... #

202
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,380
'His first win for Marlboro McLaren.'

203
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,820
You're still extremely fast.
How do you do it?

204
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,940
Big balls.

205
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,420
# Though we never
thought that we could lose

206
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,260
# There's no regrets... #

207
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,580
But Hunt's victory is short-lived.

208
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,860
In the scrutineering area
afterwards,

209
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,980
there was this unheard-of situation

210
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,420
where the car was disqualified

211
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,700
and that was something nobody in
Formula One really was prepared for.

212
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,220
Teams are allowed to modify the car
to suit each circuit,

213
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,260
but they must work within
strict regulations.

214
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,700
One centimetre in a Formula One car

215
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,100
makes such a big difference.

216
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,580
In Spain, Hunt's car had been found
to be just over a centimetre
too wide.

217
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,660
Before the race, the car was
measured by the organisers,

218
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,300
and every day,
they didn't say anything.

219
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,340
I'm pretty sure
they were talking to Ferrari

220
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,980
cos there was kindred spirit there -

221
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,020
the Spanish-speaking Catholic
country.

222
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,260
Ferrari were saying,
"Sh! Keep it shtoom. Say nothing."

223
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,820
I was never involved
with the scrutineering.

224
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,620
I was involved with MY
scrutineering, with my cars,

225
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,660
because I want that my car respect,
100%, the rules, because otherwise,
Ferrari kill me.

226
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,300
Hunt's points are given to Lauda -

227
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,540
and it looks like McLaren will
leave Spain empty-handed.

228
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,140
We immediately appealed
cos we thought

229
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,620
the penalty didn't fit the crime.

230
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,100
It was like being hung for
stealing a loaf of bread.

231
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,940
They pretend in the appeal to say

232
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,860
that this was difference was
not affecting

233
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,020
the performance of the car.
BLEEP.

234
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,820
Had you any idea that the car
might be thrown out?

235
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,700
No. I don't know,
I just drive the damn thing.

236
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,140
Although their teams are at war,

237
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,700
both drivers are trying to steer
clear of politics, but despite

238
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,980
their different characters,
their passion for racing is a bond.

239
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,700
Niki spent time in our pits.

240
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,660
He was always visiting us and his
grasp of English was very good.

241
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,620
He was always known as The Rat,
cos he looked like a rat.

242
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,380
So he was called Rat to his face.

243
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,780
James said, "Hello, Rat."

244
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,220
They meshed well,

245
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,060
because they weren't actually
directly in competition from looks.

MUSIC: "Tear The Roof Off The Sucker"

The wild side of '70s
Formula One is revealed in this

248
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,540
recently discovered
footage of an after-race party.

249
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,580
Hunt is the star -
with Lauda in the wings.

250
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,660
For sure,
Niki was in awe of James' good looks

251
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,300
and personality.

252
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,220
James was the good-looking playboy

253
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,660
and Niki was the small Austrian

254
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,660
who looked like a rat.

255
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,260
They were good friends,

256
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,860
though on the racetrack, of course,
no quarter given.

257
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,460
The race driver persona can change

258
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,700
completely - once on the racetrack,
all this is forgotten.

259
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,420
All successful racing drivers
are invested with an enormous ego.

260
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,460
They all think they're the quickest.

261
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,740
They can't imagine they're not the
fastest racing driver in the world.

262
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:17,220
To admit to anything else but that
would be ludicrous.

263
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,100
Niki and James both though they were
the best racing driver in the world.

264
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,460
As the season approaches halfway,
and even when the points from Spain

265
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,860
are reinstated, it's Lauda who still
dominates with double Hunt's points.

MUSIC: "More Than A Feeling"
by Boston

267
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,900
When the Grand Prix circus moves
to Britain, the country is

268
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,180
sweltering in temperatures
reaching 35 degrees centigrade.

269
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,020
Skirts were getting shorter.

270
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,300
It was getting hotter.

271
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,020
England was baking, the whole
of Europe was. It never rained.

272
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,740
We slept in the garden for months.

273
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,220
It was quite a remarkable year,

274
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,820
in more ways than one.

275
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,940
But behind the sunny mirage,
Britain is in the grip of political

276
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,380
uncertainty and economic upheaval -
inflation is rampant

277
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,260
and for ordinary people,
the future is anything but certain.

278
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,780
We all know how hard
the employment market is just now

279
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,380
for new entrants

280
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,060
and I know how much harder it is

281
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,420
and has been for many of you
to get your first job.

282
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,660
# More than a feeling... #

283
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,860
The return of Hunt
is a welcome distraction.

284
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,580
I think the British public saw James

285
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,260
as a sort of hero figure...

286
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,860
Hello, girls.

287
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,580
..somebody they could admire

288
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,940
who was giving two fingers
to the Establishment.

289
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,060
It looked good in what might be
a rather austere time for other
people.

00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,940
He didn't really care what
people thought.

293
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,820
Hunt's unpredictable
personality is a potential

294
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,700
problem for the team's sponsor,
Marlboro cigarettes.

295
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,740
HE COUGHS

296
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,220
Excuse me, I've been
training for my new sponsors.

JACKIE STEWART LAUGHS

298
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,660
Image is everything for the American
brand and John Hogan, the man

299
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,740
from Marlboro, has been tasked with
keeping the young sportsman in line.

300
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,660
He was this very brash figure

301
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,660
with a trail of destruction
behind him.

302
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,220
That was going to be
new for McLaren,

303
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,980
which was quite a straight-laced
organisation

304
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,820
and also for his sponsors -

305
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,100
which were also straight-laced
organisations.

306
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,300
In the year colour television sales
overtake black-and-white, Hunt's

307
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,780
car flashes Marlboro's distinctive
red-and-white brand across the

308
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,380
screen - and with it, he brings
his own unique splash of colour.

311
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,980
was, to James, pretty normal.

312
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,380
Because he had this...I don't know
what the British call savoir-faire,

313
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,980
he was able to carry it off.

314
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,740
James changed the way
Marlboro looked.

315
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,060
It was the first
and probably only example

316
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,940
of a sponsor being moulded
by the driver and not vice versa.

317
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,140
'This is Brands Hatch, just outside
of London in the Kent countryside.

318
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,340
'Today is British Grand Prix day.

319
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,220
'The biggest day on Britain's
motor-sport calendar.'

320
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,340
The race is sold out.

321
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,060
Britain is in the grip
of Hunt Fever.

322
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:06,900
A record 80,000 spectators fill the
circuit and all eyes are on one man.

323
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,220
Brands Hatch is packed.

324
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,340
Every grandstand is packed,
every grassy bank is packed.

325
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,100
The reason - because they're hoping
to see the first English victory

326
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,300
in the John Player British
Grand Prix

327
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,780
since Peter Collins won,
in a Ferrari, of course,

328
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,260
way back in 1958.

329
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,460
At Brands Hatch, what you had was

330
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,580
a front row, after qualifying,

331
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,580
which looked as though it was
setting the race up perfectly,

332
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,620
because you had Niki Lauda
and James Hunt

333
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,220
on the front row,

334
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,260
Clay Regazzoni behind
in the other Ferrari.

335
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,660
There is drama right from the start.

336
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,860
Clay Regazzoni managed to
drive into the back wheel

337
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,820
of Lauda,

338
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,780
so the two Ferraris actually
collided.

339
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,540
Complete mayhem began.

340
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,380
'Laffite sends Hunt flying.'

341
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,380
James' car landed
on the left front corner,

342
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,260
but being a McLaren, didn't break.

343
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,540
And being James, with the two pints
of adrenaline, he didn't stop.

344
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,020
He charged off with the front wheels
splayed out, like this.

345
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,660
'Drivers who escaped the pile-up

346
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,420
'are soon flagged down
and the race called to a halt.'

347
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,460
James was immediately thinking,

348
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,740
"I've got to get back to the pits
and have the car mended."

349
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,340
I got out of trouble completely.
I never hit anybody.
I stopped on the left.

350
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,580
And they BLEEP came and piled
into me.

351
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,180
Can you tell us what happened?

352
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,260
There's a race going on, dear boy.

353
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,460
The race has ground to
a complete halt.

354
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,540
The organisers want to restart
immediately

355
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,340
but Hunt's damaged car is
not on the grid.

356
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,220
In the chaos, in the pit,
he comes running up to me.

357
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,660
I said, "What's the car like?"
He said,

358
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,580
"The car's destroyed, a write-off."

359
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,740
I wandered down to have
a look at the race car

360
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,740
and realised the race car was
repairable.

361
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,500
James explanation that it was
a "write-off" was not true.

362
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,140
Caldwell and McLaren will have to
act quickly. There are only minutes
to spare.

363
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,820
It was thought that James Hunt
would not be allowed

364
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,340
to take the restart.

365
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,700
And the crowd got behind James
as a driver they wanted to see
in that restart

366
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,980
in a way that you don't see
outside a soccer match.

367
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,020
SLOW HANDCLAPPING

368
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,820
The slow handclap which ran
from the start/finish line

369
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,780
all the way up to Paddock Bend
and all the way round South Bank

370
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,620
and round to Westfield Bend

371
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,060
and then it became boos
and then it became catcalls.

372
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,900
CROWD: We want Hunt! We want Hunt!

373
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,780
Then, the marshals had to
rush onto the track,

374
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,900
to pick up beer cans and coke cans
and even bottles.

375
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,180
I've never seen, at a motor race,

376
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,340
quite such an extraordinary
display from the public.

377
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,580
"We want James Hunt,
we want James Hunt."

378
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,340
A mini riot was going on...

379
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,740
which was not very British.

380
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,620
McLaren were delighted that there
was this confusion and delay

381
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,860
because it gave them a little more
time to mend James Hunt's car.

382
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,140
'When they return to the grid,
the crowd goes wild.

383
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,660
'Now James Hunt is certain
to start again.'

384
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,860
Ferrari, you could see them,
their faces fell

385
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,940
cos they knew instantly what
had happened -

386
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,140
we had fixed the race car.

387
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,580
What I remember most of all

388
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,420
is Niki Lauda in a rage,
getting back into his car.

389
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,860
He had suddenly realised how
much time had passed

390
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,180
and that McLaren had had
time to repair

391
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,140
their race car again
and get it onto the grid,

392
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,580
and he was absolutely livid.

393
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,980
'Back to the grid,
and off they go again.'

394
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,900
After another chaotic start,

395
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,740
Lauda storms ahead, with Hunt
chasing hard on his tail.

396
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:06,260
'The battle's really on now
between Niki Lauda and James Hunt.'

397
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,900
Niki Lauda in the Ferrari leading,

398
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,540
James Hunt,
cheered on by the British crowd,

399
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,180
gradually winding him in.

400
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,660
As we went past half distance,
the cars go round

401
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,540
Paddock Bend,
down to the bottom of the hill,

402
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,660
up the hill and behind the trees.

403
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,620
As the cars then came back
into our sight,

404
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,860
the McLaren was in front.

405
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,180
And that's when the crowd erupted.

406
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,500
# It's more than a feeling... #

407
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,940
'Britain's James Hunt, in a Marlboro
McLaren, wins the British Grand
Prix.'

408
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,980
And we did win the
British Grand Prix, fair and square.

409
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,860
James, how much does this
victory mean to you?

410
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,420
Nine points, $20,000
and a lot of happiness.

411
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,900
Can I grab that cigarette off you?
Thanks.

412
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,260
CHEERING

413
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,620
But Ferrari is about to
spoil the party...

414
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,580
I think Ferrari appealed
straightaway after the race

415
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,020
that we didn't comply
with the rules.

416
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,460
We couldn't work out what
kind of rule they thought

417
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,340
we hadn't complied with.

418
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,980
The rule says, and I am surprised but
I am not surprised Alastair doesn't
know well the rules,

419
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,260
that is another example,

420
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:41,740
that you have to complete
the racecourse, even if the race
is suspended.

421
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,700
Instead of completing a lap,
as the race was stopped,

422
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,460
Hunt had taken a shortcut
back to the pits.

423
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,140
In cutting behind the Paddock,

424
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,180
he didn't complete the race distance.

425
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,980
Simple than that.

426
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,740
For now, the race winning
points are Hunt's, but the result

427
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,660
hangs in the balance, waiting on a
hearing scheduled for months later.

428
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,340
The next race is at the notorious
Nurburgring in Germany.

429
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,940
The Nurburgring was a frightening
but fantastic racetrack.

430
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,980
It's 14.7 miles round,

431
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,220
goes up and down thousands of feet,

432
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,140
it's got hundreds of corners.

433
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,420
It was generally hostile to
fast racing cars,

434
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,540
which was part of its appeal.

435
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,620
Three-times World Champion Jackie
Stewart had driven the course to

436
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,900
highlight the dangers of a track
that had claimed more than 50 lives.

437
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,620
Every time I see this,
it frightens me.

438
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,740
There's no barriers
on the right-hand side,

439
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,300
there's just a rock face
and trees.

440
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,820
You have a left-hand-side barrier

441
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,260
but that's not where you'll
go off the road.

442
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,300
I think if I were to walk round them,

443
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,900
I would he horrified and never drive
round the place again.

444
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,540
The faster you drive round the ring,
the less you know,

445
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,780
and maybe that's
the best thing to do.

446
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,660
For a quick lap at the Nurburgring,

447
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,060
you probably experience
more in seven minutes

448
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,780
and six or seven seconds

449
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,740
than most people have
experienced in all their life.

450
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,220
It was a pre-health-and-safety era.

451
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,060
Motor racing was dangerous.

452
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,980
It said so
on the back of every ticket.

453
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,220
And it was part of what it was.

454
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,220
Nearly every year in Formula One,
a driver had been killed.

455
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,860
By this stage, I'd lost

456
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,780
my brother in a racing car accident.

457
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,780
After that, I thought,
"I won't befriend racing drivers.

458
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,780
"I'll have them
as people who work for me,

459
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,180
"but I won't become their friend,

460
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,660
"because I don't want to go
to their funeral as a friend.

461
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,300
"I want to go
as their team manager."

462
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,740
For Lauda, the Nurburgring isn't
worth the risk.

463
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,580
He calls a meeting of the drivers
in an attempt to have it stopped.

464
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,260
But his fellow drivers don't agree.

465
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,580
He loses by one vote,

466
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,540
and now has no choice but to race.

467
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,380
For the first time in the season,
it is raining on Race Day -

468
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,060
but the track is
so long that not all of it is wet -

469
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,700
the choice of tyres will be crucial.

470
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,460
Wet tyres, they're quite tall -
they have

471
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,580
big tread on them like a road tyre,
unlike the slicks,

472
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,620
which are smooth, no tread at all.

473
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,380
Like most of the field, Lauda starts
the race on wet weather tyres

474
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,820
but quickly discovers he is losing
too much speed on every dry

475
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,100
section of the track.

476
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,900
After the first lap,

477
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,340
many drivers come into the pits

478
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,500
to change the tyres,
it was really chaos.

479
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,980
The pit stop was a little bit slow.

480
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,340
When Niki started
for the second lap,

481
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,300
with the slick,

482
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,020
he was about maybe

483
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,660
in tenth position.

484
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,220
For a driver, it's not good

485
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,580
psychologically to go to
race on a circuit

486
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,980
that you judge is too dangerous.

487
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,540
It puts you in a condition
that you are afraid.

488
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,980
When he restarted on the second lap,

489
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,540
it was not the cool Niki

490
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,460
that we know.

491
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,100
Lauda will not complete the lap.

492
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,620
His helmet comes off in the impact.

493
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:11,700
He is trapped in a fire burning
at over 400 degrees centigrade.

494
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,740
It will be nearly a minute before
Lauda is pulled from the flames.

495
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,260
I put his head on my lap.
Didn't want him to lie flat.

496
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,420
But he was conscious
and talked all the way through.

497
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,860
He said, "Is my face burned,
is it burned?"

498
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,900
I replied, "Don't worry, it's OK."

499
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,620
In fact,
his forehead was badly burned

500
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,260
and his scalp was actually charred.

501
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,980
rather than telling him all this,

502
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,220
we tried to keep him as quiet
and composed as possible.

503
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,060
Lauda is rushed to hospital.

504
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,500
Amongst the drivers who arrive just
after the crash is James Hunt.

505
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,700
We weren't aware Niki was in trouble
because there were racing
drivers at the scene

506
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,900
and he was conscious
and talking to everybody

507
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,140
so the drivers came back to the pits
and said,

508
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,380
"Niki's burnt but he's OK,
he's fine."

509
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,780
With the track cleared, the race is
restarted and Hunt is victorious.

510
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,980
He is now just 14 points
behind Lauda.

511
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,740
Then the news came
through that he was

512
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,260
gravely ill,

513
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,500
so that cast a shadow over
the whole thing.

514
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,020
I can remember it now and thinking,
"He isn't going to live,"

515
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,740
and I felt absolutely horrendous.

516
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,580
I felt like the bottom had
fallen out of my world.

517
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,780
When we arrived at the hospital,

518
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:19,660
Niki was, little by little,
losing consciousness.

519
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,540
Whilst Lauda battles for his life,

520
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,100
Ferrari are already
looking for another driver.

521
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,460
I was speaking with Ferrari
all the time about the accident

522
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,980
and Ferrari said to me,

523
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,540
"Ferrari will live,
with or without Niki.

524
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,740
"You don't need to stay
in the hospital.

525
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,580
"We need you to go
back to the circuit

526
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,140
"and find another driver,

527
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,860
"because if Niki will not drive,

528
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,980
"Ferrari will not stop."

529
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,300
Once he had been the protege
of Enzo Ferrari, but for Enzo,

530
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,940
giving up on the World Championship
is not an option.

531
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,020
Press and the public like to
concentrate on the driver as being

532
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,660
the most important member
of the team, but he's not at all.

533
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,700
A driver is very much replaceable.

534
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,420
The unfortunate idea of the two
McLaren drivers

535
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,940
being involved in a motorway
accident together

536
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,700
and dying -

537
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,060
do you think their team would be
in the back

538
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,500
row of the grid at the next race?

539
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,700
No, they won't be,
cos they'll just hire

540
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,460
two more hot shoes
and they'll be right up there.

541
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,260
Hunt takes full
advantage in the next two races,

542
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,780
closing the gap to just two points.

543
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,900
With Niki Lauda, his main opponent,

544
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,580
likely to be in hospital
for some time,

545
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,580
his chances of winning
the title are pretty good.

546
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:44,300
Lauda has second and third-degree
burns to his face and hands.

547
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,220
Part of his scalp has been
burnt away.

548
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,940
He has lost half of one ear
and his lungs are barely working.

549
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,300
I was suddenly aware,
through the accident,

550
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,900
how quickly you can die.

551
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,780
I remember my wife coming

552
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,260
and she burst in tears,

553
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,100
so she was very much affected
when she saw me there.

554
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:17,380
I said, "BLEEP, if she's crying,
I must be in a bad stage."

555
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,260
But in racing, the risk

556
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,420
and taking chances was
exactly the same

557
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,540
as it was before,

558
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,540
because this was part of the game.

559
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,740
'Just 40 days after doctors had
given up hope

560
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,940
'and a priest had
knelt at his bedside,

561
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,980
'the Austrian ace climbed
back into the cockpit

562
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,940
'of his glaring red Ferrari.

563
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,740
'His friends and colleagues claim

564
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,780
'that his miracle recovery had more
to do with his iron will

565
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,780
'than with master surgery.'

566
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:03,900
With five races left and everything
still to play for, Lauda is back.

567
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,020
When I came to the hospital,

568
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,860
you feel a kind of...

569
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,260
you feel you are very tired.

570
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,460
And you would like to go and sleep

571
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,740
but you know it's not just going
sleeping, it's something else.

572
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,420
And then you just fight
with the brain.

573
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,100
You hear noises

574
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,540
and you hear voices
and you just try to listen

575
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,300
to what they're saying
and try to keep your brain working

576
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,740
and to get the body ready to fight
against illness.

577
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,380
I think this was very good
that I did that

578
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,140
because in that way, I survived.

579
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,740
Niki Lauda

580
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,580
was recovering so fast

581
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,540
that he proposed to Ferrari

582
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,660
to race in Monza.

583
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,780
Ferrari said, "No, don't,

584
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,460
"because if we lose the championship
at the end of the year,

585
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,700
"it's better you don't start
so early,

586
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,140
"because then
we can say you had an accident.

587
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,900
"This was exactly
the opposite of what I was thinking."

588
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,380
At Lauda's side is his wife,
Marlene.

589
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,220
She has been with him
throughout his recovery but

590
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,060
Monza is the last place
she wants him to be.

591
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,260
Monza, Italy.

592
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,140
Home to Ferrari and their fans.

593
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,060
After coming within
seconds of being burnt to death,

594
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,060
Lauda returns to a hero's welcome.

595
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,340
When we went to Monza,
the focus was on Niki -

596
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,140
110%.

597
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,420
We took him inside

598
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,220
the garage,
he took out the balaclava

599
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,060
and his face was a mask

600
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,580
of blood.

601
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,300
I said, "My God, how can he race?"

602
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,700
It was pouring with
rain on his return.

603
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,980
This is the Nurburgring carrying on,
almost, you know,

604
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,860
the gloom of the Nurburgring.

605
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,060
Is there any psychological
after-effects from this

606
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,700
accident for you at all?

607
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,340
I don't think so.

608
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,700
Everything looks good.

609
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,780
Lauda prepares to go
back on the track to

610
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,780
race against the clock for his place
on the starting grid.

611
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,100
The pressure was on. Ferrari called.
Should I race or not race?

612
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,820
It was a huge pressure on me
for that particular race.

613
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,420
The physical scars have begun to
heal but the mental ones run deeper.

614
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,900
I came to the circuit,
wanted to drive out of the pits
and couldn't drive.

615
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:44,740
And I suddenly was hit by the whole
four weeks' accident problems -

616
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,460
all these kind of things.
And I just couldn't drive.

617
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,340
I did one slow lap,
went back into the pits.

618
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,500
I said, "I go back there
and I drive for myself."

619
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,380
And in the end of the day,

620
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,460
I was quickest Ferrari

621
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,700
and was right back like before.

622
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,780
Just before the race begins,
Hunt's team, McLaren, are having

623
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:34,060
problems of their own - their fuel
has been ruled to be illegal.

624
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,060
We were made to pump the fuel
out of our cars,

625
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,140
fill up with standard
fuel at the racetrack

626
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,740
and start on the back of the grid.

627
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,180
So we were shafted by the Italians.

628
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,260
But they're very good at this.

629
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,340
The Italian Mafiosi

630
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,580
managed to get us on the back row of
that grid.

631
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,980
How is it feeling,
fighting against Niki again?

632
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,620
Hard work.

633
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,500
When he first met him, James said
straightaway,

634
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,300
"Niki, you're the only person I know
who could be in a fire and come out
better looking."

635
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,220
For Niki,
this race is life-or-death.

636
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,500
"I finish and I go in the points
or I lose the championship

637
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,140
"here in Monza."

638
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,820
Stuck at the back of the grid,

639
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:27,140
Hunt makes a charge on the first
lap, but as he tries to fight his
way through,

640
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:31,380
he almost immediately spins
out of the race.

641
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,500
'The partisan Italian crowd
cheers for only two things today -

642
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,300
'a Ferrari competitor

643
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,900
'or their most serious
challenger for the World Championship

644
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,300
'in trouble.

645
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,900
'Here it is - the latter.'

646
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,860
Poor James didn't enjoy
the walk back

647
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,540
past the Italian fans.

648
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,100
Actually, knowing James,
he probably loved it.

649
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,420
Lauda's wife, Marlene,
can only watch.

650
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,980
Incredibly,

651
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,820
Niki finished not only the race,
but finished fourth.

652
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,900
That was something incredible.

653
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,140
CROWD: Niki Lauda!

654
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,380
Hunt and McLaren jet off to practise
for the Canadian Grand Prix,

655
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,740
but their troubles
are far from over.

656
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,980
In Paris, Ferrari presents its case
for overturning McLaren's

657
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,580
win at the British Grand Prix.

658
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:32,660
There were gentlemen in blazers
wearing old school ties

659
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,380
who were meant to decide on matters

660
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,020
of whether people should be
disqualified,

661
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,140
drivers should start or not start.

662
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,380
None of them really seemed to have
read the rule book very clearly.

663
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,220
These three old boys turned up

664
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,860
and were introduced to the saintly
Niki before they went in,

665
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,700
which was all part of Ferrari's...

666
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,580
..psychological warfare.

667
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:05,140
So they all went in, going, "We've
touched the hand of Saint Niki..."

668
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:10,180
The verdict goes against McLaren
and nine vital points are deducted.

669
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,060
So we didn't win
the British Grand Prix,

670
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,860
and there's no appeal to
this appeal.

671
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,300
That's the end of it.

672
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:22,580
With so many points lost and only
three races to go, the odds are

673
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:28,060
heavily against Hunt, and the strain
is showing between him and Lauda.

674
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,420
I hope that on the other
end of this telephone

675
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,940
we have James Hunt, who's a very
long way away in Toronto.

676
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,540
Hello, James. Good afternoon to you.
'Afternoon, Frank.'

677
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,140
Disappointed with this decision
but are you really surprised?

678
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,260
'Yes, I was very surprised

679
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,740
'because, as far as the rules were
concerned,

680
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,420
'there was no question -
Ferrari had no case.'

681
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,660
We've just pulled off the tapes
here in London

682
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,860
as I've been talking to you
a quote from Niki Lauda.

683
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,460
He has reacted to the news,
quite understandably, by saying,

684
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,020
"I'm madly delighted,"

685
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,980
and he goes on to say that,

686
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,180
"I am satisfied, not just
because this will be good for me,

687
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,740
"because at least a positive
decision has been taken

688
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,100
"in the interests of the sport."

689
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,460
What do you say to that?

690
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,180
'Well, it's the sort of rubbish
you'd expect.

691
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,580
'The guy has, you know,
had a very bad accident.

692
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,820
'He's been very brave
and done every well.

693
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,460
'But he'd do well to
considerate it as a sport.'

694
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,940
I see. You are very critical
about the way he behaves, are you?

695
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,340
'Niki isn't a sportsman -
Niki's interested in one thing,
and that's Niki.'

696
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:28,380
I don't want to discuss
if the decision was wrong or right.

697
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,260
At least, I expected James to
react in the same way -

698
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,860
to respect me as a driver.

699
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,100
And fight
if he wants against Ferrari.

700
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,740
I decided we couldn't possibly
win the World Championship

701
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,220
from this position now
without these points

702
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:47,260
and stopped trying to control
James' excesses,
which became quite excessive.

703
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,740
MUSIC: "Rhiannon" by Fleetwood Mac

704
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,380
We were staying in a great, big
motel

705
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,420
on the side of the freeway
in Toronto

706
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,180
and there was a live
band in the bar.

707
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,980
And the lead singer was a bit like
Stevie Nicks - blonde,

708
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,820
little dynamite creature,
so James managed to pull her.

709
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,660
We had to get up early in the
morning to go out to the warm-up

710
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,300
and he came down, dishevelled,
with this lady -

711
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,140
obviously...anyway..

712
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,900
"dishevelled" might be the best
way of putting it, staggered off

713
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,300
to the racetrack,

714
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,660
won the race!

715
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,140
# You can go your own way... #

716
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,220
Sex - the breakfast of champions.

717
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,060
In this particular case,
it worked out.

718
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,980
The win in Canada gives Hunt
nine vital points

719
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,860
and in the next race,
he remains on form.

720
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:50,860
He storms through to another victory
and takes the podium.

721
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,540
But Lauda is still
ahead by three points.

722
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,340
After 10 months and 15 races,

723
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,820
the championship has come
down to the very last Grand Prix.

724
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,300
For the first time ever,
the final race is in Japan.

725
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,380
Excitement about the season has
reached fever pitch -

726
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,020
only three points separate
Hunt and Lauda.

727
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,780
This will be the first race ever to
be broadcast live by satellite
across the world.

728
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,700
Determined to win it,
so in order to do that,

729
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:29,660
the best way for me
to do it is to the win the race here.

730
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,980
But on race day,

731
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,900
the weather threatens to bring
the season to a premature end.

732
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,380
'It couldn't be
worse at the Fuji circuit.

733
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,420
'Pouring rain, thick mist
and it's a delayed start,

734
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,580
'so is the Japanese Grand Prix
on or off?'

735
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,340
All the drivers got together
and said,

736
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,140
"This is ridiculous."

737
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,420
Not only was Niki Lauda saying that,

738
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:55,460
James Hunt also said,
"This race should not take place."

739
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,500
Being nice and wet again.

740
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,980
James and Niki were both
on the Drivers' Safety Committee,

741
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,780
so they were in the tower, arguing

742
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,820
that the race shouldn't be held,

743
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,900
so we had this direct confrontation.

744
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,100
I said to him, "If we don't race,
James, you can't win the World
Championship."

745
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,740
"No, Jack, we can't race -
it's too dangerous."

746
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,780
All very above board

747
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,740
but a bit irritating when you're
trying to win the World Championship

748
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,300
and you can't if you don't race.

749
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,980
The race has now been
delayed for nearly two hours.

750
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,500
The rain continues to fall

751
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,540
but the race organisers have
reached a decision.

752
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,060
The race director came in and said,

753
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,660
"We have to start."

754
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,140
We all looked out and said, "Excuse
me? It's the same rain as before.

755
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,780
"Why?" "Because of television."

756
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,020
In two hours, it will be too dark.

757
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:48,580
And we have the satellite TV that
cost a lot of money.

758
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,220
And we have a contract with
the organiser

759
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,660
to at least start the race,
otherwise we lose money.

760
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,820
The teams, the drivers,
I lose the money

761
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,220
if we don't at least start the race.

762
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,020
'But the race is on.

763
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,300
'James Hunt, in his McLaren,

764
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,300
'getting ready for a lap
of the circuit

765
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,140
'and next, out comes Niki Lauda

766
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,020
'to join the grid with
the rest of the competitors.'

767
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,460
The drivers have been forced
onto the starting grid

768
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:17,860
by the demands of the vast TV
audience they have created.

769
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,780
'This, then, is the clincher -

770
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,820
'the World Championship decider.

771
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,620
'Three points separate the leader,
Niki Lauda, in the Ferrari,

772
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,940
'and Britain's James Hunt
in the McLaren.

773
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,300
'It's going to be a fantastic race.'

774
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,580
In Britain, it's three
in the morning.

775
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,020
Hunt's parents and friends
are watching the live satellite

776
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,740
broadcast in a TV studio, but his
sister, Sally,

777
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,380
is at home, glued to the radio.

778
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,740
We switched on the radio very
early in the morning

779
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,580
and I can remember walking
round the house

780
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,180
with the radio clamped to my ear.

781
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,020
The tension was amazing.

782
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,260
'Who is going to reach
the corner first?

783
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,780
'James Hunt takes
the lead in the Japanese Grand Prix

784
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,740
'and fifth, that's Niki Lauda.'

785
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,500
Hunt takes the lead
but for the other drivers following,

786
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,660
the water spray is dangerously
reducing visibility to almost zero,

787
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,980
and all the cars are skidding
and sliding in the heavy rain.

788
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:22,020
'Brambilla going through and Hunt has
leapt round. They haven't let him
through.

789
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:26,180
'Side-by-side, and Brambilla spins!

790
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,340
'And he missed Hunt by inches.

791
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,900
'And Niki Lauda has
pulled into the pits in front of us.

792
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,940
'The world champion has
gone into the pits.'

793
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:41,420
Niki stopped -
"It's too dangerous, I stop."

794
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:45,900
'Yes, this amazing 1976
World Championship series

795
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,060
'is maintaining its drama,

796
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,740
'because Niki Lauda,
leading the World Championship,

797
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,180
'is out of the race,

798
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,500
'but, amazingly enough,
there's nothing wrong with his car.'

799
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,900
I tell him,
"Niki, what you have to say

800
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,540
"is that you have a technical
failure or something."

801
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:05,900
"No," he said to me, "tell them
that it is too dangerous to race."

802
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:12,380
When you are a normal racing driver,
and you are not affected

803
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,540
by an accident,

804
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,140
you have reserves.

805
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,780
So that means your level
of risk-taking

806
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,700
is higher

807
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,500
than, like in my case,
you've just come out of death

808
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,700
and had everything happening to you.

809
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,260
Then, a couple of races later,

810
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,900
you have to face this
more-difficult situation

811
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,140
with the water and rain and risk
going up,

812
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,900
and at that time, I was not prepared
to take this extra risk,

813
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,300
because of the accident.

814
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:45,580
Emotionally, for me,
it was impossible to tell Niki

815
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,460
to go back to race,

816
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:52,340
because you see his eyes were
really terrorised.

817
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,180
Lauda is out of the race.

818
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,420
But he will still become
World Champion

819
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,460
if Hunt fails to score
enough points.

820
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,420
Then the rain stopped and the water

821
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,460
disappeared on the circuit

822
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,300
and the circuit got better -
by coincidence, basically.

823
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,980
But I was not racing
and I would still do the same today.

824
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,300
Hunt must finish third or higher
to take the championship,

825
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:30,300
but as the track dries out, his
wet-weather tyres begin to overheat.

826
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,940
One of the techniques you could do
was cool them down

827
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,620
by running in puddles
deliberately on the straits.

828
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,620
So we put this sign out -
"cool tyres",

829
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:43,500
but James refused to
acknowledge or do this.

830
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,540
"Cool the tyres! Cool the tyres!"
And he's down the middle

831
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,980
of the road, oblivious.

832
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,140
Eventually,
he wore all the rubber off them,

833
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,100
all the canvas, down to the air.

834
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,660
And he had TWO flat tyres.

835
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,660
With five laps to go,

836
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,580
he came into the pits.

837
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,660
We thought perhaps it would all
go wrong for James.

838
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,820
'And Hunt is in the pits
in second place,

839
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,340
'and if he drops below fourth,

840
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,780
'if he goes out,

841
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,980
'his World Championship will
be in danger.

842
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,620
'What an incredible
change of fortune...'

843
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,260
Because he had two flat tyres,

844
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,300
we couldn't jack the car up
very well,

845
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,980
so the car was too low to get
the jack underneath,

846
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,980
so a mechanic and I had to pick up
the left front of the car,

847
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,780
so it took us
24 seconds or something

848
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,420
to change the tyres.

849
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,260
'And James Hunt gets away.

850
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,500
'And now he is in fifth position

851
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,940
'and out of the contention.'

852
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,100
With the championship
seemingly beyond his grasp, Hunt,

853
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,820
the sportsman, throws caution
to the wind and makes his charge

854
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,860
for the finish.

855
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,220
'And James Hunt is passing Jones!

856
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,780
'Hunt is fourth and Regazzoni
is out of the race,

857
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,020
'so now Hunt moves up to
third position.

858
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:00,260
'And James Hunt IS going to
win the World Championship

859
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:04,340
'if he just keeps
going in the place he's in now.

860
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,100
'And he does it.'

861
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,460
James Hunt finishes third.

862
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,500
James Hunt is champion of the world.

863
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,940
THEY CHEER

864
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,820
We were all whizzing about
sort of cheering

865
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,900
and excited because James was
now World Champion.

866
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,340
'I think the scenes in the McLaren
pits will speak for themselves.'

867
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:35,780
But right now, Hunt himself has no
idea the championship is his.

868
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,180
James Hunt came into the pits

869
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,580
in a rage

870
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,220
and as the McLaren team
gathered round,

871
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,180
James got out of the car,

872
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,780
pulled off his crash helmet,
started to rant and rave at them,

873
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,260
and Teddy Mayer was holding
up three fingers

874
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,220
saying, "James, you're third.

875
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:58,380
"You're Champion."
And gradually, the penny dropped.

876
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,260
It was an extraordinary moment.

877
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,020
There was a lot of excitement and,
"Does he know yet?"

878
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,180
and, "Is it true?"

879
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,820
Suddenly it was true
and he was World Champion.

880
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:18,260
Hunt has won,
despite ignoring team orders.

881
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,100
I was not best pleased with him.

882
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,140
You won't see me
in any of the photographs.

883
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,580
I'm nowhere near him,

884
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,580
cos I just want to punch him
in the mouth.

885
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,980
Even though he IS
the World Champion.

886
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,980
'I feel really sorry for Niki

887
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,860
'in that I feel sorry for everybody
that the race had to be run

888
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,060
'in such ridiculous circumstances.

889
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,100
'Quite honestly,

890
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,540
'I wanted to win the championship

891
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,940
'and I felt I deserved to win
the championship.

892
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,180
'I also felt Niki deserved
to win the championship

893
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,700
'and I just wish
we could have shared it.'

894
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,460
I said at the same time,
at the time there,

895
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,940
if anybody should get
the championship,

896
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,740
then I'm happy it's James.

897
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,700
Because I liked him

898
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,740
and we were not buddies
but we are at least sympathetic,

899
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,460
so I think we took
care of each other

900
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,540
from the heart in a very nice way,

901
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,780
which in these days, the heart was
never shown in Formula One.

902
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,820
MUSIC: "Young Hearts Run Free"
by Candi Staton

903
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:23,100
'Hunt, who came into Heathrow
early today, said,

904
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:27,140
'"I don't think I've stopped
celebrating since the race."'

905
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:30,100
We met James coming home.

906
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,780
There was James looking
slightly dazed,

907
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,140
he was probably
so completely out of it.

908
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,740
He'd drunk quite
a lot on the way home.

909
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,340
Very tired and somewhat hung over,
thank you very much.

910
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,540
What was the party like?

911
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,660
It was long. But good.

912
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,660
Then we all went off to a party.

913
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,220
I have to say my memory's
a bit hazy after that,

914
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,580
because I think I drank more
champagne for breakfast than

915
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,380
I ever had before.

916
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,020
Hunt and Lauda would never have
such a close race again

917
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,100
but the legacy of the first
superstars of Grand Prix

918
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:13,420
helped shape Formula One into the
global TV sport it is today.

919
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:13,500
The excitement of that season meant

920
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,580
that no self-respecting country

921
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,980
could allow its television service

922
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,780
not to cover Formula One properly.

923
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,220
So suddenly,
Formula One was available everywhere.

924
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,500
We had James
and Niki coming out of this

925
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,860
as these two titans of their time.

926
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,580
Who could have predicted that?

927
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,820
It was just the most amazing season.

928
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,380
'In life, you need a certain
amount of luck.

929
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,580
'The question is how much
luck you need.

930
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,780
'I think the luck is the minimum.

931
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,660
'I think human beings can
do much more

932
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,020
'for themselves than they think.'

933
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,900
We have to remember only
the good things.

934
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,100
That was a good fight.

935
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,540
I don't think I thought of him
as my little brother then,

936
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,140
although that's what he was.

937
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:07,740
I just thought,
"It's James, who I love,

938
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:11,660
"and my friend, and he's achieved
what he wants to achieve."

939
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,460
That was very exciting.

940
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,860
'How do you want to do it?

941
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,740
'Go at a steady pace for 70 years

942
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,820
'or flat-out for ten years
and then relax,

943
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,500
'and I rather like doing it
that way.'

944
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,580
At the time, you said,
"If you wrote this as a film script,

945
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,660
"people would say,
'That's ridiculous.

946
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,060
"'You've got to have something
believable. You can't have this
farcical story.'"

947
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,020
But the farcical story is true.

948
