00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:48,007
I'm kidding.

352
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,624
[Exhales deeply]
Yo, you got me, there.

353
00:13:50,823 --> 00:13:52,545
Hey, could I ask you a favor?

354
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,881
I need someone
to practice my beauty stuff on.

355
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:56,950
No problem, girl. Do your thing.

356
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,911
Yeah? Cool. Thanks.

357
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:02,956
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

358
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,924
I thought you were just gonna
style my hair or something.

359
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,460
What I really need to learn
is ear piercing.

360
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:11,462
You know Brandon Lee
had an earring, right?

361
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,812
True dat.

362
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:18,371
<i>Ooh, this was crazy.</i>

363
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:20,773
<i>It was the closest
I'd ever been to a girl</i>

364
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:23,176
<i>who wasn't my mom,
a dentist, a nurse...</i>

365
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,688
[piercing gun clicks]
[Echoing] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

366
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:29,772
Quick... "propensity."

367
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:31,941
P-r-o-p...

368
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:32,824
Ensity.

369
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:34,154
Propensity.

370
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,584
"Ensity"?

371
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:38,625
Wrong. Here's the word.
Write it five times.

372
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:43,444
How was your first day
as a licensed realtor?

373
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:46,981
Ohm, you know,
it... it was the same.

374
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:48,682
It didn't feel any different.

375
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:50,347
But it had to feel
a<i> little</i> different, right?

376
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,485
You're legit now.

377
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,554
Actually,
I was thinking about it,

378
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:57,723
and... I feel like
I have conquered that world.

379
00:14:57,743 --> 00:15:00,494
I'm ready to move on
to something else.

380
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:02,429
Don't be silly.
You're great at this.

381
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:04,531
Hey, can I see your license?

382
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:05,666
Uh...

383
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,001
Oh, it's in the car.

384
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:09,322
Don't worry.
I know you photograph angry.

385
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,376
I don't care.
I just want to see the license.

386
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:15,700
Oh... Well, let me just get it.
[Chuckles] [Laughs nervously]

387
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,262
In my purse.

388
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:18,511
Let me just get it.

389
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:20,079
[Chuckles]

390
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,815
[Sighing] Oh.

391
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,719
[Inhales sharply]

392
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:27,920
[Sighs]

393
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:30,456
A little zip-zip...

394
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:31,146
[Gasps]

395
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,026
Oh, no! Someone has stolen it!

396
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:35,597
[Gasps]

397
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:38,197
[Lock clicks]

398
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:39,932
No one leaves
until we find out who.

399
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,774
It's definitely grandma.

400
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:48,078
Jessica, I know
you didn't take the test.

401
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:51,294
- What?! No! I...
- I ran into Honey.

402
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,049
- Hey!
- Judas priest! A...

403
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:57,231
Whoa. [Chuckles]

404
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,961
She told me everything.

405
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:01,635
The only thing that woman runs
more than her legs is her mouth.

406
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:03,661
She's worried about you.

407
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:05,092
[Sighs]

408
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:07,536
Okay, it's true.
I didn't take the test.

409
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:11,039
Here's the thief, mommy.

410
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:14,745
_

411
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,417
_

412
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,398
See ya, girl.

413
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:21,603
Trent: Dude, let's go!

414
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:22,571
Get your bike out!

415
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:23,572
W-what's going on?

416
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,340
Shaq's at the barbecue store
at the mall!

417
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,241
What?!

418
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,643
He's getting
his propane tank fixed.

419
00:16:27,677 --> 00:16:29,278
Just before that,
he was at Mrs. Fields,

420
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:30,779
getting one of those
giant cookies.

421
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:33,067
But I bet to him,
it's a<i> regular</i> cookie.

422
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,656
Dude! Is that an earring?

423
00:16:38,676 --> 00:16:41,190
Yeah. Nicole tagged me
like her own personal wildcat.

424
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:42,224
You look like a fool!

425
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:43,922
We're losing focus!

426
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:45,464
Eddie. Eddie, get on.

427
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:47,765
Hey, Eddie!
I just found my henna stencils.

428
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:50,147
Can I practice
decorating your hands?

429
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:54,352
Too long, Huang. We got to go.

430
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:57,605
Shaq! We're coming, Shaq!

431
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,941
We forgive you for "Shaq Fu"!

432
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,710
What's going on?
Why didn't you take the test?

433
00:17:02,744 --> 00:17:04,111
What's the point?

434
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:06,347
No matter how many houses
I sell, I'm never gonna catch up

435
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:08,282
with people who've been doing it
for 10 years.

436
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:09,517
[Sighs]

437
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:11,819
It's too late in the game
for me to be the best.

438
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:14,355
[Sighs] Why do you always
have to be the best?

439
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:17,491
Because I tell the boys<i> they</i>
always have to be the best.

440
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:19,615
So your answer is to just quit?

441
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:20,920
I'm not used to this!

442
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,164
Well, you're also not used to
having a full-time job,

443
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:26,584
living in Orlando, having
a husband with perfect hair.

444
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:29,046
A lot of things in life
are new for you.

445
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,700
All that matters
is you<i> do</i> your best.

446
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,716
Isn't that a better example
for the boys than quitting?

447
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,427
I like quitters
even less than losers.

448
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:39,583
Mm-hmm. It goes like this.

449
00:17:39,603 --> 00:17:41,486
It goes quitters, losers,

450
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:44,131
cats, kleenex, Martin Sheen,

451
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:46,643
redheads, croissants, buttons...

452
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:49,198
Emery: Quick!

453
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:51,424
What are the zoning laws for
a noncommercial establishment?

454
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:52,726
I just opened the book.

455
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
Wrong!

456
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:55,361
Here's the answer.
Write it five times.

457
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:56,363
[Pen clicks]

458
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,552
It's fun when mommy's bad.

459
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:00,865
Hey, mommy won't be bad
for long.

460
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:02,059
I crunched the numbers,

461
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,364
and if I sell 20 luxury homes
a year, I can beat Kim.

462
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:09,343
Plus, she's gonna turn 40 soon,
panic, and do I.V.F.

463
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,885
That'll bench her
for a few months.

464
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:13,871
But that's not what's important,
right, Honey?

465
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,515
Right, right. No, right.

466
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:18,050
Hey, mom. I'm home.

467
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:19,604
Just gonna get a jump
on my homework!

468
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:20,986
Love you!

469
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,154
You love me?

470
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:22,937
[Gasps]

471
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:24,489
What are you hiding?

472
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:26,324
Nothing.

473
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:29,071
An earring?!

474
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:30,495
Eddie!

475
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,330
I take my eye off you
for five minutes,

476
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:33,999
and you do<i> this?</i>

477
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,752
- And what are these?
- No...

478
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:37,402
Eddie!

479
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:38,970
I can't belie...

480
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:41,139
my goodness.
Your hands are beautiful.

481
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:42,841
Is your ear pierced?

482
00:18:43,126 --> 00:18:45,210
You are in so much trouble.

483
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:47,308
I'm just doing
what dad told me...

484
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:49,098
treating Nicole
like a restaurant.

485
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:51,383
- You told him this was okay?
- No. N...

486
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:54,955
I told him to spend time with
her and find shared interests.

487
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:57,235
Which is what I did!
She did all of this.

488
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:59,809
I-I can't even look at you
with that thing.

489
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:01,682
Here... put this back on.

490
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:05,630
You look like
an Indian Elmer fudd.

491
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:06,598
[Sighs]

492
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:08,500
I said "shared interests."

493
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,250
What are you doing?
You're not into this stuff.

494
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,419
I know. And I missed
seeing Shaq at the mall.

495
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:14,588
He was power-browsing,
and I wanted to go,

496
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:17,157
but Nicole wanted
to henna my hands.

497
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:19,180
What was Shaq browsing
at the mall?

498
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,734
Cookies and propane.

499
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:21,667
Hm. That makes sense.

500
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,130
You figure
he can't buy clothes there.

501
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:25,156
This is stupid!

502
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,618
I'm just gonna give up.

503
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,286
Eddie, no.

504
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:32,669
I'm not quitting,
and you are not, either.

505
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,278
Just be yourself.

506
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,382
If that's not good enough,
that's not the girl for you.

507
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,679
[School bell rings]

508
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:46,683
Hey, wait. Where's your earring?

509
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:47,887
I took it out.

510
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,154
And the henna wouldn't come off,

511
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,957
so you'll just have to imagine
that's gone, too.

512
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:53,711
I thought it looked great.

513
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:56,840
Honestly, I'm not really into
any of that beauty stuff.

514
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,665
But you should totally
go for it. You're good at it.

515
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:02,409
And after I'm done
being grounded,

516
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:04,112
if you want to do something
that's<i> not</i> lame,

517
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:06,246
like watch basketball
or whatever,

518
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:08,149
I'd be down.

519
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:13,798
By the way, I heard Shaq<i> wasn't</i>
really at the mall yesterday.

520
00:20:13,818 --> 00:20:16,582
It was just some big black guy
in a mustard-colored suit.

521
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:19,998
Oh, I know. Dave was crying
at the bus stop this morning.

522
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,088
I mean, where do you
even get a suit that color?

523
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:24,823
And calling everybody "cousin."

524
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:27,192
That guy<i> knew</i> what he was doing.

525
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,261
Bam!

526
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,964
I did it. I passed the test.

527
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:35,100
Congratulations!
I knew you could do it!

528
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:36,168
[Laughs]

529
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:39,134
We still have
some of your cake left.

530
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:41,173
Who did that?

531
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:43,966
Who on earth improved this cake?

532
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,697
<i>You</i> did.

533
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:51,159
Star fighter to mission control.

534
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,268
My radar's been shot out.
I don't have eyes.

535
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,406
My shields are up,
but I don't know for how long.

536
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:56,463
[Imitates static]

537
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:58,217
[Deep voice] There's someone
here who wants to talk to you.

538
00:20:58,237 --> 00:20:59,709
[Imitates static]

539
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:01,025
[High-pitched voice]
Honey, it's me.

540
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:02,312
[Imitates static]

541
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,829
You're the bravest
star fighter ever.

542
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:07,584
Come back for me and the kids.
I love you.

543
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:09,252
[Imitates static,
radio squawk]

544
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,654
[Normal voice]
I love you, too, Maureen.

545
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,656
Who's Maureen?!

546
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:15,036
[Laughs]

547
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:16,888
I knew you were listening.

548
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,261
[Groans]

549
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:20,291
Go to bed!

550
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:23,561
Star fighter out.

551
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:27,253
Oh no I pressed the wrong button.
