1
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:03,780
<i>Okay, gather round,
everybody, gather round.</i>

2
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:05,181
<i>Gather round, please.</i>

3
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:06,983
<i>I have a, uh, a presentation.</i>

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,818
Now, because of everyone's
A.D.D., I know I'm gonna

5
00:00:08,886 --> 00:00:10,453
lose your attention in
about three minutes,

6
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:11,921
- and, uh, Frank's gonna fall asleep.
- No way.

7
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:14,424
I slept 26 hours last night.

8
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:16,893
You still seem very sleepy.
Can I start my presentation?

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,429
Where's the easel? No, no, I'm not
using an easel... don't interrupt.

10
00:00:19,496 --> 00:00:21,397
You want me to go get the projector?
No, I don't want the projector.

11
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:23,266
And I don't want the easel.
What are you gonna point with?

12
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,767
Don't want whatever the
hell you're gonna say.

13
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:27,150
'Cause it's all gonna be old
and outdated, all right?

14
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,837
Let me start my presentation,
which is actually about that.

15
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:30,172
It's about innovation.

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,341
Not taking questions. Goddamn.

17
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,209
Let me do my thing, okay?
Stop interrupting.

18
00:00:34,277 --> 00:00:38,180
Okay, so, um, as we all know,
um, tomorrow is St. Paddy's Day,

19
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:39,915
traditionally our
most profitable day.

20
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:43,218
However, recently, profits
have been declining.

21
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:45,754
Every year.
And we need to change.

22
00:00:45,822 --> 00:00:47,489
We need innovation.

23
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:49,124
We need to move Paddy's
from the past and into...

24
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:52,194
the future,
a mobile Paddy wagon.

25
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:53,896
Now, these days, people like
to have things on demand.

26
00:00:53,963 --> 00:00:56,265
So instead of having
to go to a bar,

27
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:59,034
we will bring the bar to you.

28
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,470
Ooh, is that, like, a car
service type of thing?

29
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:03,405
Where we pick people up and
take 'em around from bar to bar

30
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:05,074
and jack up the prices?

31
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:06,875
That's actually a really good idea.
Uh, no.

32
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:08,710
The Paddy's wagon <i>is</i> the bar.

33
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:10,145
No, Dennis.

34
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:11,613
If we want to make money,

35
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:13,549
we need to honor ancient
Irish traditions,

36
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:16,318
like serving an irresponsible
amount of booze to people

37
00:01:16,386 --> 00:01:18,253
who are genetically predisposed
to having alcohol problems.

38
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:19,588
- Right.
- You see,

39
00:01:19,656 --> 00:01:21,056
St. Patrick started
that tradition,

40
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,424
and that's why we
celebrate him today.

41
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:23,859
Yeah... No, that's
not what he did.

42
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:25,828
No, he-he played
the flute for some kids,

43
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,729
and then he lured them
into a cave somewhere,

44
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,331
- and he diddled them.
- Nah.

45
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,834
You got him mixed up with the Pied Piper.
Right.

46
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:34,136
St. Patrick didn't
play the flute.

47
00:01:34,204 --> 00:01:35,904
He drove the kids
out of Ireland.

48
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:37,406
And then he molested 'em.

49
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:39,641
No, no, if-if St. Patrick
molested kids,

50
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,276
he would be regarded as a scoundrel.
No, no, no.

51
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,679
I feel like, in the olden days
of the Catholic Church,

52
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:45,681
pedophiles were
regarded as heroes.

53
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:47,116
All right, all right,
look, g-guys, uh,

54
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:48,884
St. Patrick didn't do
any of that shit, okay?

55
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:49,952
He drove the snakes
out of Ireland.

56
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:51,386
Uh, I-I don't know
about all this.

57
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:52,688
I kind of want to just do
the traditional thing

58
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:54,256
of, like, sticking
around the bar

59
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,824
and-and trying to catch the leprechaun.
No, no!

60
00:01:55,892 --> 00:01:57,493
No, we don't want to do a
leprechaun thing again.

61
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,495
Stop, stop, guys...
I'm gonna catch one.

62
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:01,163
I'm, like, this close.
You're not gonna catch him

63
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:02,898
because he doesn't exist.
Guys, please...

64
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:04,286
You know what...
I don't even know

65
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:05,767
if I've set up
my glue traps for him yet.

66
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,136
Charlie, enough
with the leprechaun!

67
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:08,804
I mean, can you believe him?
Okay, wait.

68
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:11,206
Who cares? Look, I'm trying to...
You know what,

69
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,114
actually... I might
want to get myself a flute.

70
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,843
I was thinking the same thing.
We've been talking... you were?

71
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:16,545
Yeah, because I-I feel like
it's a really fun...

72
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:18,213
I know we're kind of old, but...
Go get a flute?

73
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,381
Go get a flute, yeah.
Go get... go get a flute!

74
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:21,116
Everybody go get a flute!

75
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,252
In the sixth grade,
I feel like it's kind of simple.

76
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,953
Frank, look...

77
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,022
All right, let me
explain it to you, at least.

78
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,190
No, he's gone.

79
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:30,092
Okay.

80
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:48,789
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com.</font>

81
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:56,378
So, Frank, here's the plan.

82
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:59,251
We're gonna fill the wagon
with hip, attractive clientele.

83
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:01,186
We're gonna use my streamlined
system to process drink orders.

84
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:02,587
We're gonna take photographs
with a retro filter

85
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:04,055
for the Web site.

86
00:03:04,123 --> 00:03:05,991
And that will entice
future end users

87
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:07,993
to comment
and spread brand awareness

88
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,195
over various
social media platforms.

89
00:03:10,263 --> 00:03:11,897
That seems insanely complicated.

90
00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:13,932
Why don't we just take cash?

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,267
No, no, no, no. What I'm talking
about's way simpler than cash.

92
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:17,302
It's-it's streamlined.

93
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,504
I'm lost. It's... I'm
trying to explain it to you

94
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:21,373
and I feel like you're not
even listening. I-I...

95
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,408
Top o' the morning,
you filthy lads.

96
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:27,212
I'm fixing to have a whale of
a time in this here mobile pub.

97
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,647
I'm so sorry... what is this?

98
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:31,249
Crazy Paddy, you big, dumb arse.

99
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:32,951
Yeah. Why?

100
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,253
'Cause it's fun. No.

101
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,189
I thought that's the thing
about St. Patrick's Day...

102
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:39,024
People want clownery and-and
they want to embrace

103
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:40,892
the Irish stereotypes. No, no, no.
This isn't innovative.

104
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,828
It's outdated and it's gonna
offend people.

105
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:46,097
Well, I brought my piece in case
anybody gets out of line. Oh, I...

106
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:47,766
Okay, Frank, Frank,
look... no guns.

107
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,634
Let go. No guns, no costumes.

108
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:51,770
Trust me, I got this.

109
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:53,572
Frank, you're gonna drive.
Drive.

110
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,973
Okay, Dee, you're
gonna serve drinks. In the back.

111
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,908
As a human being. A real one.

112
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:58,109
Mm. Guys,

113
00:03:58,177 --> 00:03:59,077
I'm gonna provide...

114
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:00,378
the experience.

115
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:02,981
Ooh.

116
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,216
Okay, yeah. Yeah, right?

117
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:05,684
Yeah, I like this. Nice.

118
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:07,752
I... See, I told you.
I know what I'm doing.

119
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,187
Come on, let's go.

120
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:10,689
Frank, you're driving.

121
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:12,991
Okay. Here we go.

122
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,632
Ho! Check it out, Mac...
Got some cool stuff.

123
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,168
I got some green paint
and I found a snake.

124
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:25,804
Great. Why?

125
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:27,739
You know, the snakes, 'cause,
like, we... I don't remember

126
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:29,674
where we landed on St. Paddy,
but I remember snakes

127
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:31,910
were involved. And the green
paint's for the, uh, beer.

128
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:34,112
Okay, love the snake.
Great catch there.

129
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,147
But why not just use food
coloring for the beer?

130
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:37,616
Uh, 'cause beer's not a food.

131
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:39,317
When was the last time
you ate a beer?

132
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:40,905
When was the last time
you drank paint?

133
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:44,816
Have you been drinking paint?

134
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:47,926
No.

135
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:49,461
Let me see your tongue.

136
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:51,796
Oh, my God, dude!

137
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:55,066
Oh, that shit's just disgusting!
It's not bad.

138
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:57,168
You... you can't drink paint. I know.
I hear you, I hear you.

139
00:04:57,236 --> 00:04:59,170
You say that, but I don't think
that you're gonna stop.

140
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:01,206
Yeah, I get it, though, man.
It's, uh... Right.

141
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:03,575
I-I feel like you're saying you
get it, but you don't get it.

142
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:05,143
It's cool. It's not cool.

143
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:06,378
It is what it is. Oh, my God,

144
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:07,746
this is so frustrating! Look,

145
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:09,214
I'm gonna go down
to the basement

146
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:11,483
and I'm gonna check
out my glue traps

147
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,851
and see if I, you know, got a leprechaun
in there. Wait, no, no, no, no.

148
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:15,387
What... We said
no leprechaun this year.

149
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:17,222
You're not chasing leprechauns.

150
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,057
I know, and I kind of forgot
where we landed on that.

151
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,393
I got these great cookie sheets,
they're filled with glue, so...

152
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,461
But I-I hear you, I hear you.

153
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,163
It's a frustrating thing.
It's like the guy doesn't

154
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:27,065
listen to us, man, when we're
trying to get through to him.

155
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,500
It's a bummer.

156
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:34,472
No, not you.
Keep moving, let's go,

157
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,474
come on. You kidding me?

158
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:40,178
Oh, oh, h-hey-hey,
there, fellas.

159
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:41,913
What's going on?
Where you going? You know what?

160
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:44,149
Don't answer that.
Because I already know.

161
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:45,917
You're going for a ride
in the Paddy's Wagon.

162
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:48,353
Oh, cool. Is this,
like, a car service thing?

163
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:50,021
Hey, can you take us
to Center City?

164
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,290
No, it's not a goddamn car
service. Why does everyone...

165
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:54,592
You get in that
wagon right now or I'm gonna

166
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,528
sock you a good one
right in the kisser!

167
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:58,763
Yeah, you dumb bi...

168
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:00,965
What the hell are you doing?
Uh, just innovating.

169
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:02,734
I took the Paddy's wig
and I cut it

170
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:04,602
into an awesome beard.
Great new character. No.

171
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:05,637
Hilarious.
You've just created another

172
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:07,439
offensive Irish stereotype, Dee.

173
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:09,474
The Fighting Irish...
I-it's true.

174
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:10,575
I mean, that's what Irish people do.
That is not what...

175
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:12,210
They get drunk,
they fight people.

176
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:13,244
All right, I'm trying to give
these guys... Look, guys,

177
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,746
don't pay attention to her.

178
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:16,181
I-I want to give you
an authentic, um, uh,

179
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:17,916
once-in-a-lifetime
experience here.

180
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:20,151
Oh. Oh, wait, so is
this, like, a bang bus?

181
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:22,153
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not a bang bus, okay?

182
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:23,755
Look... Just get in the wagon,

183
00:06:23,823 --> 00:06:25,423
I'll give you a ride
to Center City.

184
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:27,325
Get in.

185
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:32,430
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

186
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:34,632
let me walk you through how
our simple business works.

187
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,134
God, take it easy, Frank!

188
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:38,303
Don't tell me
how to drive, you bitch.

189
00:06:38,371 --> 00:06:40,939
Let... Let's keep it light for
the customers, all right, Frank?

190
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:43,308
As I was saying, fellas,
uh, what you're gonna

191
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:44,736
need to do is you,
uh, you're gonna

192
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:45,977
take a picture of this QR code,

193
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,645
you're gonna download the app,

194
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:49,647
log in using Facebook,
and you're gonna watch

195
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:51,716
a-a brief, 30-second
advertisement.

196
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:54,018
And then once we receive
your online order,

197
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:55,620
you will promptly
be served a beer.

198
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:58,056
Can't I just pay you cash?
That's what I... Yeah.

199
00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:59,357
Well, no, cash is the way

200
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:00,759
that antiquated
companies do business.

201
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:02,193
Yeah, I just want a beer.
I don't really

202
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:03,595
want you to have
all my personal information.

203
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:04,963
A beer. Just want a beer.

204
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,297
Don't want you to have my...

205
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:07,799
Yeah.

206
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,401
Look, man, um, if I
just gave you a beer,

207
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:10,835
and you just gave me cash,

208
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:12,303
then you wouldn't
be able to experience

209
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:13,905
everything that we've
got to offer here, okay?

210
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,441
Look, I'll show you. This...
Let me just pull up my...

211
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,476
I got a little presentation
here that I put together.

212
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:21,246
But, uh, can't get the goddamn
thing to... to go online.

213
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:23,281
I don't have a signal here.
Goddamn it. You know what?

214
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,589
Dee, uh, why don't you just
give him a couple free beers?

215
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:27,085
We'll-we'll call
'em "freemiums."

216
00:07:27,153 --> 00:07:28,913
Don't know if you're
familiar with that term.

217
00:07:28,954 --> 00:07:31,823
This is like all foam.
Dee, you goddamn bitch!

218
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:33,331
Hey! Oh, this thing's
bouncing around

219
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:34,893
like a pinball. Don't blame me.

220
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,361
Keep it light, you bitch!

221
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:37,929
All right.
Yeah, this is weird to me.

222
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:39,764
Can we just get out here?

223
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:42,767
Hey, it's locked.
Can you guys let us out?

224
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:46,337
No, I'm not gonna let you out. Screw this.
I'm calling the cops.

225
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:48,306
Why would you call the cops?
We're just hanging out, man!

226
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:49,874
All right, stop, stop, stop.

227
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,709
All right, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh. Push "end." End.

228
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:54,712
Give the phones to the girl.

229
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,915
Let's go, guys. I don't want
to have to do this shit.

230
00:07:56,982 --> 00:07:59,584
Frank, we got to
pivot the business.

231
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:01,519
Mm-hmm.

232
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:02,821
Come on, get the hell out.
Everybody out.

233
00:08:02,888 --> 00:08:04,489
Out, out, out, out,
out, out, out, out.

234
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,391
All right.

235
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,092
Don't worry. We're gonna mail
your phones back to you, but

236
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,762
we're gonna need your addresses,
so fork over your I.D.'s.

237
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,363
Let's go. Come on.
And their money.

238
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:13,765
We can't have 'em
cabbing it back to the city

239
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,300
and going straight to the cops.

240
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:16,967
Goddamn it. That's a good point.

241
00:08:17,002 --> 00:08:18,770
Okay, you know what?
Dee, collect their wallets.

242
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:20,038
Don't worry, guys.
We're not thieves.

243
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:21,473
You'll get your
wallets back, too.

244
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,741
Yeah. Don't be babies.
All right, uh,

245
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:25,210
come on, come on, guys,
let's go, let's go.

246
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:26,544
Let's go. Shut the doors.

247
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:35,320
Did we just kidnap
and rob those guys?

248
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,322
We just drove the
snakes out of Philly,

249
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:38,890
the way St. Patrick did.

250
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,492
Oh!

251
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,793
So, what you're saying is,

252
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:43,595
technically, we gave those guys

253
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,763
a very authentic
St. Patty's Day experience.

254
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:47,232
Oh. Yeah.

255
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,666
Nice. In a way.

256
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,301
Oh. All right.

257
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,470
That's good. That's good. Yeah.

258
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:00,234
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Here.

259
00:09:00,354 --> 00:09:02,043
Jesus Christ, where's Charlie?

260
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,710
Hey, Mac, somebody stole my damn wallet.
What?!

261
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,545
Beat it! Beat it, Mauricio!
I need to talk to Mac.

262
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,013
Charlie, where have
you been, dude?

263
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,660
I can't run the bar by myself
and do security.

264
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,047
People are getting
their wallets stolen.

265
00:09:13,115 --> 00:09:14,615
Okay, uh, look, just come

266
00:09:14,683 --> 00:09:16,284
to the basement with me,
like, really quick.

267
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:17,552
Goddamn it! All right.

268
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:18,619
Attention, everybody.

269
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:20,021
Irish honor system.

270
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:22,089
Please serve yourselves.

271
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:24,792
Put the money in the bucket.
Thank you.

272
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,928
Uh, I don't think the Irish
honor system's a thing, man.

273
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:28,029
Oh, it's a thing.

274
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:28,930
It's an ancient Irish tradition.

275
00:09:28,997 --> 00:09:30,364
Know your history, bro.

276
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:31,832
What could possibly
be so important?

277
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,703
Charlie...

278
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:37,572
what the hell am I looking at?

279
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:41,108
I caught him.

280
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:43,144
Wake up that son of a bitch.

281
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:44,345
Dude, I think you've
kidnapped a little person.

282
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:46,080
Huh?

283
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,349
Nah... nah, nah. First of all,

284
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:49,951
I've captured
a leprechaun, okay?

285
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:51,858
You wouldn't say,
"I kidnapped Bigfoot," right?

286
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,621
You'd say, "I captured Bigfoot."

287
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:56,023
Well, that may be true,
but leprechauns aren't real.

288
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:57,491
So what we're dealing with here

289
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,093
is a little person
in a glue trap.

290
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:00,595
Yeah, I thought about that,
ruled it out, okay?

291
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:02,063
'Cause the basement door
is locked, so unless

292
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,764
he's a being
who's unrestrained by the laws

293
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:05,766
of the physical world,
he's not getting down here, man.

294
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,201
Dude, if he is a human being,

295
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:09,003
he's going to sue
the shit out of us.

296
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,831
If he's a leprechaun,
he's got a pot of gold.

297
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:12,106
Yeah...

298
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:13,441
Well, yeah, that's... No, no.

299
00:10:13,508 --> 00:10:14,575
Well, let's not rule
one out over the other.

300
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:16,043
I mean, it's very weird

301
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:17,311
that he's down here, right?

302
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:19,013
Okay. Let's ask him.

303
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:22,650
Uh, sir, I'm gonna ask
you a direct question.

304
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:26,621
Are you now or have you
ever been a leprechaun?

305
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:29,190
No, I'm not
a goddamn leprechaun!

306
00:10:29,257 --> 00:10:30,658
Please... It was
pretty convincing.

307
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:32,493
Are you kidding me?

308
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,721
If he's a leprechaun, that's
what he has to say, right?

309
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:38,032
Sir, why are you
dressed like a leprechaun?

310
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,568
'Cause it's St. Paddy's Day,
you idiots!

311
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:43,070
- This guy's good. He's good.
- Yeah.

312
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:44,205
Nasty little son of a bitch,
isn't he? You think?

313
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:46,207
There's, like,
a real bite to him.

314
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:48,242
I know. You know what
I think we should do?

315
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,944
We just rough him
up a little bit.

316
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:51,445
You know, just get the truth
out of him, just a little bit.

317
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,781
It's a great idea.

318
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:55,716
We don't want to bruise him up.
Yeah.

319
00:10:55,784 --> 00:10:58,252
You know, so, I just wish we
had, like, a hose or something.

320
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,720
Yeah. You know, we could
blast the truth out of him.

321
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:01,622
Right? That'd be good...

322
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,924
Oh, shit.
There's a hose right here.

323
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:09,230
I... I don't ever remember
a hose being down here, do you?

324
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:11,032
No. I don't know. Dude...

325
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,600
do you realize
what just happened?

326
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:15,236
You made a wish, which
the leprechaun clearly granted.

327
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:16,437
You know, everyone knows,
you capture a leprechaun,

328
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:18,305
you get three wishes, right?

329
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:20,574
So we got to think very carefully
what our next two are here.

330
00:11:20,642 --> 00:11:22,677
I wish I could live forever?
What are you doing?!

331
00:11:22,744 --> 00:11:24,445
I wish you don't. How about that?
No, no! Why did you do that?

332
00:11:24,513 --> 00:11:25,446
Why did<i> you</i> do that?
Why didn't you say,

333
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:27,415
"I wish I could live forever."?

334
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:29,183
And live forever with you?!
Well...

335
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:30,885
Look, I'm not a leprechaun!

336
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:32,887
Just let me out of here,
you dickheads!

337
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:34,388
Ah. Wish there was a way

338
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:35,690
we could just know
for sure, you know.

339
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:37,858
Charlie?

340
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:40,995
Get the snake.

341
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:44,098
<i>The problem was, Frank...</i>

342
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,201
that last group of belligerent
hooligans just didn't understand

343
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,636
how to experience
our business properly,

344
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:51,105
but I think this new group
is gonna get it.

345
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:54,508
Plus, they're physically weaker,

346
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:56,444
in case anything goes wrong.

347
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:58,112
What's happening?

348
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,180
I'll tell ya what's happenin'.

349
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:02,149
One day you're young and pretty,

350
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:04,819
and the next, the years
of drinking and abuse

351
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:07,021
have robbed you of your youth.

352
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,356
Abuse? Did these guys hurt you?

353
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:10,558
No!

354
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,693
Me husband did this to me.

355
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:14,662
Arrr!

356
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,863
Dee... Mm?

357
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:17,164
What the hell are you doing?

358
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:18,632
What are you...?
What, are you a pirate?

359
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,967
I can't tell if you're
doing a thing now,

360
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:20,968
or if this is just
who you've become.

361
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:22,036
I've giving them

362
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,437
an authentic Irish experience,

363
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,005
like you were begging for
before...

364
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:26,607
You're giving them a
completely inauthentic,

365
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:28,242
frightening experience,
and you're scaring them.

366
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,344
Okay, listen, ladies,
nobody's gonna get hurt.

367
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:31,545
Will you just let us out,
please?

368
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,013
Well, no.

369
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:34,415
No, I'm not gonna let you out.

370
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:35,883
I need you to
experience everything.

371
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:37,284
I-I have to offer,
okay, so you're...

372
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:38,753
Rahr! So, experience... Dee!

373
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,688
Shut up!

374
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:44,191
All right, look, we're gonna
have a good time here, okay?

375
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,860
You're experiencing some
free beers right now

376
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:47,561
because I can't get the
goddamn Internet to work.

377
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:49,764
That's a problem for me.
Do you guys know how to use

378
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:51,499
tablet computers? You're young.
No.

379
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:53,067
I just want to connect the
goddamn thing to the Internet.

380
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:54,368
They told me it'd be easy.
It's not, though.

381
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:56,170
Okay. Well, I'll tell you what.

382
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:58,472
I'll let you out after I take
a couple photographs of you.

383
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,074
How's that sound? Yeah?
Take some photographs

384
00:13:00,142 --> 00:13:02,843
for my... for my Web site?
So, look happy.

385
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:04,779
Look like you're having fun.
No need to cover those up.

386
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:06,247
My customers like those.
They're like me.

387
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:08,282
They're gonna want to see that.

388
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,790
Yeah, okay, so smiling
smiling and...

389
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,100
You're not convincing me. Smile!

390
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:14,421
Oh, damn!

391
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:15,923
This is not
supposed to be scary.

392
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:18,058
This is supposed to be an
authentic, fun time for you.

393
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:20,261
Yeah, all right, well,

394
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:21,829
I need to buy it, okay?

395
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:23,497
I'm... Please let us out.

396
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:25,633
I don't want to be on
your weird Web site. Shh.

397
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,368
Well, if you don't comply with
me, then you're gonna end up

398
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:29,537
on the weird one, okay?
So, smile.

399
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:31,939
Ugh! All right.

400
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:33,107
You know what?
This isn't gonna work.

401
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:34,842
All right, come on, come on.

402
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,343
Let's go. Come on.

403
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:38,579
All right, out you go, ladies.
Out you go.

404
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:40,080
I know you didn't
threaten to call the cops,

405
00:13:40,148 --> 00:13:41,549
but you would have...
I'm certain of it...

406
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:42,950
So I'm gonna need
your wallets and your phones.

407
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:44,785
Give 'em to the girl.

408
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,887
Oh, yeah, I'm probably gonna
pop on your Twitter accounts,

409
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:49,423
just so you know. Write us some,
uh, enthusiastic reviews,

410
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:50,858
which you would have done,
as well,

411
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:52,193
had you experienced
our business properly,

412
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,661
but you decided to be...

413
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:55,763
All right, well...

414
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:03,370
Talk, bitch! I'm blasting you! Come on!
Talk! Come on, leprechaun!

415
00:14:03,438 --> 00:14:05,358
Come on, leprechaun, admit it!
Where's the gold?!

416
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:07,308
Aw, what's the point, dude?
There's no water pressure.

417
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,076
I feel like I'm giving him a baby bath.
Yeah, I know.

418
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:10,644
Snake's not working either, man.

419
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:12,446
Well, that's
because the snake is dead.

420
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:14,181
Because you put it in a plastic
bag and it couldn't breathe.

421
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:15,416
All right, doesn't matter.
He probably killed it

422
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:17,518
with his leprechaun
magic, anyway.

423
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:19,920
I'm not a leprechaun,
you goddamn assholes!

424
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:21,889
Yeah, yeah, guy. How are we
gonna get his pot of gold

425
00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:24,124
if he won't even admit to us
that he's a leprechaun?

426
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:25,993
I mean, if this guy would
just admit he was a leprechaun,

427
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:27,428
we could be done with this whole mess.
Well, yeah.

428
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:29,230
- Of course.
- Okay, fine, you got me.

429
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:31,165
I'm a leprechaun. I admit it.

430
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:33,033
What?

431
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:34,835
God... I am a... I'm a...

432
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:37,705
damn... a... I'm a leprechaun.

433
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:39,740
Yeah, right, but you don't
have the accent, That's...

434
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:41,909
and that's throwing me off, right?
It's throwing me off.

435
00:14:41,977 --> 00:14:45,246
I live in a faraway land,

436
00:14:45,313 --> 00:14:46,647
and I was transported here

437
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:50,684
by a giant magical rainbow.

438
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:53,654
And you never got me
Lucky Charms.

439
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:56,090
Oh! That's it! That's it!

440
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:59,193
You were right! Dude! You caught a
leprechaun! I told you, man! I knew it!

441
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:00,961
Hey, can you let me go now?

442
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:02,630
No, you can't go. You know...
No. No.

443
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:04,377
We need your pot of gold.
Where is it? Yeah.

444
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:08,135
It's at the bottom
of the rainbow.

445
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:10,371
Hmm. Must be some sort
of leprechaun riddle,

446
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:12,339
'cause there's no
rainbows out today.

447
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:15,976
No, dude... I don't think
this guy's talking in metaphors.

448
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:18,412
I think he means exactly
what he's saying. Yeah?

449
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,080
Dude, he's talking
about that gay bar

450
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:21,882
down on Locust Street...
The Rainbow.

451
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,384
You know which one I'm
talking about, right? No.

452
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,219
Right. I'm gonna go
check it out, alone.

453
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:26,453
Why?

454
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:27,855
Well, because you'll be here.

455
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:29,456
And if, uh, the gang comes back,

456
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:32,459
they'll also be here,
and I'll be there, alone.

457
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:33,460
Right.

458
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:35,462
But you'll be here.

459
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,630
Great. Great.

460
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:38,565
All right, you go do that,
Okay. Yeah.

461
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,267
And, uh, remember, you're there
to look for a pot of gold.

462
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:42,303
Okay. Alone.

463
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,737
Yeah. You'll be there, alone.

464
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:45,639
Okay! Got it.

465
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:49,476
All right, well, that
just leaves you and me, and, uh,

466
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:52,646
we both know there's no pot
of gold at that gay bar.

467
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:54,982
So the question is...

468
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,053
what to do with the little liar.

469
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:07,094
We haven't made
a goddamn penny today.

470
00:16:07,162 --> 00:16:09,129
We actually lost money,

471
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:11,632
with all the gas we burned
going back and forth.

472
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,634
Yeah, well, it's not my fault.
The business model's flawless.

473
00:16:13,702 --> 00:16:15,369
If you knew how to drive
and you knew how to serve

474
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:17,738
a goddamn beer, we wouldn't
be in this mess.

475
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:20,174
Hmm.

476
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:22,509
All right. Mmm.

477
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:25,546
Okay, everybody out.
Get out. Let's go. Come on.

478
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:27,648
Go, go, go, go, go. You guys
are in the wrong demographic.

479
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:28,949
Where have you taken us?

480
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:31,418
Right. Yeah, I guess, uh,

481
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:34,421
we got so used to our routine of
picking people up and dropping

482
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:36,623
'em off outside of town
that we never even tried

483
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:39,827
to sell you people beer, did we?
They're too old, anyway.

484
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:41,829
Who's gonna watch 'em on a Web site?
That's true.

485
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:44,298
Yeah, you guys are a little too old
for our, uh...

486
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:47,301
So... Wallets and phones.
You know the drill.

487
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:52,606
I don't know why we don't
just do the car service thing.

488
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:55,509
People seem to be really needing
rides all over the town.

489
00:16:55,577 --> 00:16:58,078
No, you know, that idea may work.
You think so?

490
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:00,180
Thank you. You're welcome.

491
00:17:00,248 --> 00:17:03,183
Oh. B-But before we
pivot to that one,

492
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:05,519
um, Deandra,
you mind, uh, jumpin' out

493
00:17:05,587 --> 00:17:08,288
to see about the gas cap?
I think I left it off.

494
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:09,957
Yeah. Oop.

495
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,497
Oh! Hey!

496
00:17:16,564 --> 00:17:18,499
Oh, goddamn!

497
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:20,367
Goddamn it...!

498
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:25,572
What you did there, Frank, that's, like...
Very funny. Yeah. That bitch

499
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,641
was dragging us down. Yeah.

500
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,476
She was driving me crazy, man.
Oh.

501
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:32,046
Oh... shit. What?

502
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:33,480
She didn't put the gas cap on.

503
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:36,150
Oh, is it open for real?
Big-time.

504
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:37,584
Oh, shit. Yeah, let me
grab that real quick.

505
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:39,186
I got it.

506
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:42,756
No, no, no, no, n...
Aw, goddamn!

507
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:03,737
I can't believe Uber jacks up their
prices just because it's a holiday.

508
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:05,124
That's unbelie... It's a scam.

509
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:07,092
We should have been doing
that the entire time.

510
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,228
Are you kidding me?
That was my whole idea.

511
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:10,797
Dee, stop trying to take
credit for everything. Wait...

512
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,210
What is going on in here?
Weren't Mac and Charlie

513
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,190
taking care of the bar?
Yeah, they were.

514
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,098
- Why is the bar empty?
- It ain't empty.

515
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:20,268
What are you doing back here,
you piece of shit?

516
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:23,636
It's a long story.
The business hit a wall,

517
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:26,207
went up in smoke,
and then went under.

518
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:28,042
Why are you speaking
in metaphors?

519
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,911
It ain't a metaphor.
I fell asleep,

520
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:33,481
crashed into a wall,
the engine burst into flames,

521
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,450
and I had to drive it into a river.
Right.

522
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:39,053
What the hell is that?

523
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,955
♪ ...to keep this smile
from my face ♪

524
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,690
♪ Listen, Tony ♪

525
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,960
♪ I'm all over the place ♪

526
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:49,230
♪ Clowns to the left of me,
jokers to the right ♪

527
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:51,232
♪ Here I am, stuck in
the middle with you... ♪

528
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,269
Well, you may be a man.

529
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:56,171
You may be a leprechaun.

530
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:58,706
But only one thing's for sure:

531
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:00,208
You're in the wrong basement.

532
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:02,243
Goddamn it! No!

533
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:05,580
I'm gonna see if you bleed green.
No! No! No, no, no!

534
00:19:05,648 --> 00:19:07,715
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Charlie, Charlie,
what the hell is... Whoa, whoa. Hey!

535
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:09,717
What are you doing?

536
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:12,153
What does
it look like I'm doing?

537
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:13,788
It looks like you've tied
a little person to a chair

538
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:15,690
and you're gonna torture him.

539
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:18,026
No, I've tied
a leprechaun to a chair,

540
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:20,995
and, uh, yeah,
I was gonna cut him to pieces.

541
00:19:21,063 --> 00:19:23,665
Charlie...

542
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:24,933
you been drinking
straight paint?

543
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,367
Yeah.

544
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:27,635
Charlie, he's not a leprechaun!

545
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,037
Do not hurt him! I repeat:

546
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:31,372
He is not a leprechaun! Oh, hey.

547
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,875
What is this?
Why are you covered in glitter?

548
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:35,310
I would love to answer
all of your questions,

549
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,212
but there is no time.

550
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,714
You see, I went to the Rainbow
to look for a pot of gold.

551
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:40,715
The gay bar? Oh.

552
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,150
Again, no questions.

553
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:43,685
And when I got back,

554
00:19:43,752 --> 00:19:46,688
I found this bag...
full of wallets,

555
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:48,323
hidden where we keep the towels.

556
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,390
Why did you need towels?

557
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,459
Not answering questions, okay?

558
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:55,163
Because apparently this son
of a bitch is a pickpocket.

559
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:57,031
That's why he's been
lurking around Paddy's.

560
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,867
Oh! Well, that makes a lot
of sense, 'cause he kept saying,

561
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:02,070
like, "I'm a pickpocket. I'm
a pickpocket. Stop hurting me."

562
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:03,738
"I'm not a leprechaun." And
I just thought that was, like,

563
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:06,541
a metaphor for, you know,
"I-I am a leprechaun."

564
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,142
This little son of a bitch
has been picking pockets

565
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,711
at our bar every St. Paddy's Day

566
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:11,179
- for years.
- Well, we got a whole bag

567
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:13,681
full of wallets and phones, too.

568
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:16,417
You did? That's good. Because the
bar did not do so great. Yeah.

569
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:18,853
Turns out the Irish honor
system, that's not a thing.

570
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:20,321
Yeah, we were gonna
actually return the wallets

571
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:21,623
that we got, but, uh, Yeah.

572
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,091
Since no one seems to be...

573
00:20:23,158 --> 00:20:24,626
being honorable, uh,
maybe we keep our wallets

574
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:26,127
and those and, you know, Yeah.

575
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:28,896
Chalk it up as a win. Yeah.
Oh, the luck of the Irish.

576
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:31,032
Let's not make
it a tradition, though.

577
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,934
Sure. Yeah, probably
better not to.

578
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:36,704
All right, well, what do we do
with this piece of shit?

579
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:56,953
Oh, shit, that leprechaun
just flew up a rainbow!

580
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:01,672
Stop drinking paint, Charlie.
Huh.

581
00:21:02,338 --> 00:21:06,516
