1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,300
THIS is why a man returns
to the place of his birth.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,620
I was born in a bed meself. I often
feel the pull of that! Often?

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,200
Don't you mean always? Probably.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,260
In the pursuit of law and order
I've had to grab my share of gonads.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,220
I hope he's washed his hands!

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:29,400
But eventually, a man comes looking
for peace, scenery, the little pub
in the next village... Gone.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,000
Damn! It's a theme pub now.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,980
Why does the Almighty permit things
like that? You can forgive
the odd earthquake, but theme pubs!

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,380
It plays Irish music.

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,440
I can see God in all the big things,
but I often wonder about the small.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,460
Will he know about riding a bicycle
or how to make a good cup of tea?

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,220
Me mum could make a good cup
of tea...when she were sober.

13
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:04,440
I remember your mother.
When was she sober? From Tuesday
till they opened on Friday.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,140
As long as that?!

15
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,220
I'm reminded of the old saying that
nothing good comes without effort.

16
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,280
But that was before they'd heard
about careers in senior management.

17
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,400
What's that long, creepy thing?
..No, not Truly, the other one.

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,500
It's a centipede. After all those
years in the city, even I know that.

19
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,020
It's got a hundred legs.
Just like the bloke that's
next to you on a crowded bus.

20
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,920
They don't have EXACTLY a hundred.

21
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,660
They DO.
That's why it's called a centipede.

22
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:24,160
But are you a reliable witness?
I was Sergeant Truelove CID.
Truly of the Yard.

23
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,460
Famous for being accurate except,
when necessary, in the witness box.

24
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,780
Now, repeat after me,
"Centipedes do NOT have
exactly one hundred legs."

25
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,840
All right. Ninety-nine...PLUS ONE!

26
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,900
It's just a rough description.
Not meant to be taken too seriously.

27
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,300
Like the marriage vows these days.
It's got ONE HUNDRED legs!

28
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,360
I think it's marvellous the way
it keeps them under control.

29
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,400
I've got two legs
and I can get THEM entangled.

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,180
Look at him poking around
with that creepy-crawly. I'd sooner
have dead people any time!

31
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm counting its legs.

32
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,520
Here, I'll hold it, you count 'em.

33
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,600
No, don't hurt it! Who's hurting
it? I know how to handle it.

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Nobody else is going
to handle it. Oh, and what about
the things tha's had to handle?

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,580
A policeman's lot
is not always a happy one.

36
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,760
I made it 78.

37
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,740
And I'm a trained police observer
with commendations for the neat
appearance of my notebook.

38
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:46,140
You were nowhere NEAR its legs.
You were far away enough to send it
a postcard! It could be poisonous!

39
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,560
It's NOT poisonous.
Maybe not to you.

40
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,120
One bite of you and that's it -
on its back with 78 feet in the air.

41
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,140
It can't be 78 otherwise they'd
call it a seventy-eightipede!

42
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:05,220
No, they wouldn't. They'd open it
out to the nearest round figure.

43
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:12,720
Speaking of round figures, did you
see Nora this morning? She did look
smart. Can you tell the difference?

44
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,020
It's her legs - no wrinkles.

45
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:23,040
Can we not talk too much about the
ladies? I swore an oath of chastity
after my divorce.

46
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,420
Now I'm dedicated to eradicating
evil and pursuing the perfect pint.

47
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:35,480
Why did she divorce thee? I think
she resented my being prettier
than she was. It was so unfair.

48
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,680
I used to say, "Mabel, everybody's
prettier than you."

49
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,740
Looks like you're on your own
with the ladies.

50
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,780
I'll manage, Norm. I know me duty.
..Why has tha never liked women?

51
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,300
Well, I had a bad experience.
Tha still got married.

52
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,780
That was it.

53
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,360
She moved when they pulled down
Emsley Street.
I remember.

54
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,800
They should have left Emsley Street
and pulled down the people there!

55
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,920
He left her shortly afterwards
to better himself in insurance.

56
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,580
He once sold ME a policy.

57
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,580
Oh, did he make any...

58
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,420
suggestions?

59
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,220
He suggested I bought more insurance.

60
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,200
Oh. He had a reputation for
being forward with female clients.

61
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,260
Not in MY house, he didn't.

62
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,820
Some people were getting more visits
than he could possibly account for
by the premiums.

63
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,220
Hey up! I told thee...

64
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,580
no wrinkles!

65
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,240
Don't you be looking at me legs!

66
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,740
Well, it beats looking at that hat.
Sit yourself down!

67
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,820
Sit down at the table
and I'll bring your tea over!

68
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,900
By heck! You get escorted
to your table now!

69
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:08,120
Do you always take him into places?
He should be outside
tied to a drainpipe.

70
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,000
He'd only bark at passers-by.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,700
I would, Norm.
Oof! Oww-ww-wwwww!

72
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,540
Hey up, I bet HE'S a laugh a minute.
He's not bothering YOU.
There isn't a bother in him.

73
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,080
Maybe he's from Harrogate.

74
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,100
I've seen him somewhere...
He's familiar.

75
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,160
Hey up, are we going to have a bun?
Not till you wash your hands.

76
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,140
What's wrong with me hands? You've
just been handling centipedes.
Only gently.

77
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,700
Oh, yes!

78
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,100
Oh, I like the legs, Nora!

79
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,120
A touch o' class!

80
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,000
Ohh!

81
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,280
Three buns, please. Who's paying?
Not me. I held the centipede.

82
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,140
I counted the legs. Wrongly.

83
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,380
We'll have three buns, Ivy.

84
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:13,040
It's easier paying than listening
to them. I want something big
and sticky-fingered.

85
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,880
Like your Kevin?
Oh, he went straight.

86
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,340
Straight into somebody else's house.
He changed when he got married.

87
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,580
Into a suit.

88
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,980
He does. He looks familiar.
It's his personality.

89
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,420
Probably reminds you of a wardrobe
or a switched-off TV.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,860
MOTOR CHUGS

91
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,700
Way-hey! A little cracker!

92
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,900
STAIR CREAKS

93
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,700
Where do you think you're going?

94
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,000
For a stroll, my love. Stroll round
the best bedroom, with a duster.

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,540
I've just BEEN round with a duster.
Did you do the top of the wardrobe?
Yes, I did.

96
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:41,020
Yesterday I did the top
of the wardrobe, and there wasn't
any more dust on it then.

97
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,540
If I find any fluff under that bed...
Fluff?! We don't even have DUST.

98
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,600
As every fleck comes in,
I'm waiting to pounce on it.

99
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,120
I know what YOU'RE waiting
to pounce on.

100
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,620
Do you realise, we're almost
a dustless environment.
We're nearly sterile.

101
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,780
I ought to go for a stroll -
just to breathe a few germs.

102
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,920
When I said put on your working
clothes, I didn't mean a suit!

103
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,920
These ARE me working clothes.
You can't help me father in a suit.

104
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,280
Do I have to help your father on me
day off? He's behind in his project.

105
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,780
I thought we could go for a drive
or something. Ooh, let's do that!

106
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:38,380
Ohh... Later, when you've helped me
dad. Now, put on some dirty clothes.

107
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:45,320
I don't HAVE any dirty clothes.
Oh, don't tell me father.
He'll think you're unnatural.

108
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,720
..And watch WHERE you're strolling.

109
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,420
Where ARE you going?

110
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,960
Wherever the spirit leads.
Especially not there.

111
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,840
You're not letting him go
in broad daylight?

112
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,680
I can't keep him indoors.
There must be something
he could do.

113
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,040
Believe me, I've tried.

114
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:26,572
Excuse me. Now what?

115
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:30,692
What are you playing at?
I've finished MY bun.

116
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:36,692
We heard. It sounded like someone
in a rubber Mac being sucked
through a revolving door.

117
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:42,772
It's not fair to torment
other people with pieces of bun!
It's not tormenting Clegg.

118
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:45,972
Clegg is not easily excited.

119
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:48,512
Oh, it's nice of you to say so.

120
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:55,552
I attribute it all to the benefits
of a low-temperature marriage
and regular cocoa.

121
00:10:55,552 --> 00:11:01,112
It puzzles me how tha ever managed
to get married in the first place.

122
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:03,692
Oh, it wasn't the FIRST place.

123
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:08,852
It was the third or fourth,
and even then, SHE had to ask ME.

124
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:13,612
Having said that,
she turned out quite well, really.

125
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:17,132
I was never short
of a change of vest.

126
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:21,352
She used to warm my underwear...
every Tuesday...

127
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:25,392
on a clotheshorse
in front of the fire.

128
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:27,992
It's amazing how close you get.

129
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:35,732
The former Mrs Truelove
was made of sterner stuff...
until I made her wash her own vests.

130
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:40,652
Tha did HER washing?! I just
dropped her things in with mine.

131
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:47,172
Now don't YOU start staring
into space. We've enough with him!

132
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:50,212
If there IS a heaven...

133
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:56,592
I hope there's a corner somewhere
on wet winter nights
with a coal fire

134
00:11:56,592 --> 00:12:01,952
and respectable married garments
drying together on a clotheshorse.

135
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:23,012
I wish you'd had some old clothes.
I'm wearing overalls.

136
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:27,252
Me father'll think
you're wearing a suit!

137
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:28,432
BANG!

138
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:36,852
You're not going to send me
in there? I wouldn't -
not for anybody but me father.

139
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:41,912
I'll keep checking up on you.
Don't touch anything electrical.

140
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:44,352
I'll be off, then.

141
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:59,412
It's no good, love. I can't send you
in there. I'd do anything for you,
but preferably in a suit.

142
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,192
BANG!

143
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:07,912
Great! Great stuff!

144
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:16,452
How long
is he just going to sit there?

145
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:23,452
He looks familiar. He should do.
He's been there an hour.
I'm going to ask him who he is.

146
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:27,192
Hang on! You can't do that!

147
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:31,352
That's being nosy.
Go and ask the ladies who he is.

148
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:37,672
SHOP!!

149
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:42,732
Come here.
What do you want?

150
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:44,852
It's personal.

151
00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:50,852
I'm not falling for that!
When HE gets personal,
you're struggling for your life!

152
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:53,392
I'll put me hands in me pocket.

153
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:58,912
One false move and we'll fillet you
and put you under the grill!

154
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:04,652
I'm better under a low light
on a well-sprung sofa.
What DO you want?

155
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:07,112
(Who is HE?)

156
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:12,672
(We've no idea, except
he comes in every Wednesday.)

157
00:14:12,672 --> 00:14:19,712
(I've seen him somewhere. His face
is familiar. Tha's right, lass.
I'VE seen him somewhere.)

158
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:30,692
Howard! What are you doing out
at this time?

159
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:38,192
I hope you've not thrown all caution
to the winds and come to carry me
off beyond my furthest expectations.

160
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:43,252
I'd have to be back for teatime.
There's a always a snag.

161
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:48,812
I'm on top of all me chores. She
couldn't find anything for me to do.

162
00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:53,452
I don't like you seeing me
in this scruffy overall.

163
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:57,952
You look ravishing!
I don't know about ravishing...

164
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,712
Oh, I don't know, though.

165
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:09,432
Are you sure you've finished
all your jobs? Listen, when it comes
to housework, I'm hell on wheels.

166
00:15:09,432 --> 00:15:12,052
Ohh, Howard...!

167
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:14,632
Ohh, Marina...!

168
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:17,032
Oh, crikey!

169
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:35,032
I've seen thee afore.

170
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:40,812
I come here every Wednesday. Long
afore that. The name escapes me.

171
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:44,612
Duckworth. Duckworth...
Don't go away.

172
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:50,732
He's a Duckworth.
Well, I suppose somebody has to be.

173
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:54,772
Doesn't ring a bell.
I never forget a name...

174
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:59,752
except mine, occasionally,
in the pursuit of the perfect pint.

175
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:02,292
I knew a Gladys Duckworth.

176
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:07,312
He's probably lovelier than her,
but I don't think he's a Gladys.

177
00:16:07,312 --> 00:16:12,312
She were lovely, my Gladys! She
could open bottles with her teeth.

178
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:14,852
You've had women with teeth?!

179
00:16:14,852 --> 00:16:19,832
Stick around, kid,
I'll show thee all the moves.

180
00:16:19,832 --> 00:16:23,752
I wonder where he's from...

181
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:25,892
I'll ask him.

182
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:31,972
Where does tha come from?
Golden Meadow Gardens.

183
00:16:33,112 --> 00:16:35,712
He's from Golden Meadow Gardens.

184
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:42,272
Nobody lives in a place
called Golden Meadow Gardens!
That's what he said.

185
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:50,672
People live in places like Station
Road or High Street or Crocketts
Terrace, not Golden Meadow Gardens!

186
00:16:50,672 --> 00:16:55,412
Don't mention houses.
I lost a good house in the divorce.

187
00:16:55,412 --> 00:17:00,292
I wonder what kind of swine's
washing her vests there now?

188
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:02,712
He still loves her!

189
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:07,032
I deny that.
I've got witnesses - her mother.

190
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:10,072
Her mother says I never loved her.

191
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:14,592
I mean, writing Golden
Meadow Gardens on an envelope

192
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:18,672
is enough to seriously disturb
your hormonal drive.

193
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:24,112
Even THAT'S a better address -
number 23, Hormonal Drive.

194
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:28,192
I never loved her mother,
that's for sure.

195
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:35,212
That woman could arouse in me
thoughts incompatible with being a
policeman. Only THOUGHTS, mark you.

196
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:39,252
Besides, where could you hide a body
that size?

197
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:45,072
I wonder where he lived before
Golden Meadow Gardens? I'll ask him.

198
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:49,772
..Where did tha live
before Golden Meadow Gardens?

199
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:52,132
Milton Street.

200
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:58,212
Milton Street.
Now we're getting somewhere.

201
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:02,212
As long as it's not
Golden Meadow Gardens.

202
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:08,072
Why CAN'T he help your father?
Mother, look at him!

203
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:15,092
I keep him immaculate.
How can I let him help me father?
Would YOU let him help me father?

204
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:19,732
I have to put up with the condition
your father gets into.

205
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:25,472
But you keep him outside. I don't
want to keep my Barry outside.

206
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:28,392
You will when he gets like your dad.

207
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:33,392
I could do his clerical work.
I wouldn't mind doing his paperwork.

208
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:38,732
The nearest he gets to paperwork
is standing on it in my kitchen!

209
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:44,372
Have you seen a small husband
wearing a large smile?

210
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:50,872
What's he doing out at this hour?
He's finished his chores.
Ooh, they do get tricky.

211
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:53,212
I've run out of work for him.

212
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:58,672
Funny you should say that. WE know
somebody who needs some work doing.

213
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,712
His first name is Bruce.

214
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:05,092
..It suits him.

215
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:08,312
Like a big, quiet golden retriever.

216
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:08,372
He's like a big lump. I've seen
more action on mortuary slabs.
What's he doing here?

217
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:14,712
It were his day off. He comes here
each Wednesday. He were a Duckworth.

218
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:22,592
His mother were an Oglethorpe.

219
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:29,572
You know who he is, then.
He's one of the Duckworths
that were at school when we were.

220
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:32,372
What was his nickname? Scruffy kid.

221
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:36,352
Oh, that narrows it down.
We were ALL scruffy.

222
00:19:36,352 --> 00:19:43,412
Aye, we were ALL scruffy,
except for one or two tulips whose
mothers should have known better.

223
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:47,392
I'm trying to think of his nickname!
I remember yours -

224
00:19:47,392 --> 00:19:49,812
Shirley Temple!

225
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:54,072
Only while he was wearing
his little sailor suit.

226
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:58,672
It was a very macho
little sailor suit.

227
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:02,772
The things you have to do
to attract a bit of custom.

228
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:07,312
You're at the mercy of the greed
of the man in the street.

229
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:11,512
You can't remove people's cash
without an anaesthetic!

230
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:24,332
Hello! Here comes a live one.

231
00:20:24,332 --> 00:20:32,192
This'll teach him to idle about in
broad daylight. Dick Turpin is alive
and well and lurking in my shop!

232
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:59,692
Suspect was well-built.
No distinguishing features
except a dirty nose.

233
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:03,732
Navy-blue jersey.
Always sitting on Myrtle Hobson.

234
00:21:03,732 --> 00:21:08,772
That were me. Oh, was it? Well,
he was always sitting on somebody.

235
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:11,392
Doreen Patterson.

236
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:15,832
HE can't be Doreen Patterson!

237
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:19,212
Not HIM.
That's who he used to sit on.

238
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:24,132
Coggie! His nickname was Coggie.

239
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:25,912
Hey up.

240
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:28,272
I remember Coggie!

241
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:33,292
That's right. Coggie. Now it looks
as if he's got a handkerchief.

242
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:40,332
Coggie! It is! It's Coggie!

243
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:44,592
I've not been called that
for a while. Who are YOU?

244
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:49,072
Who are WE?
Coggie, tha MUST remember us!

245
00:21:49,072 --> 00:21:54,372
Little Herbie Truelove.
Shirley Temple.

246
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:56,192
Cleggy.

247
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:03,212
And tha MUST remember me -
young Simmonite.

248
00:22:03,212 --> 00:22:09,712
Used to let you look at his ringworm
for a ha'penny.
Tha could touch it for a penny.

249
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:14,392
He was doing great
till everybody got ringworm.

250
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:19,032
Hang on a minute. You must remember
this. Anybody got a pen?

251
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:30,592
Right. Who was always doing this?

252
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:36,032
Would you like a gottle of geer?

253
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,072
Yeah! Simmonite!

254
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:41,932
Bill Simmonite! Oh, ho! Ah, ha-ha!

255
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:46,732
# Oh, the sun has got his hat on!
Hip, hip, hip, hooray!

256
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:53,892
# The sun has got his hat on
and he's coming to out to play... #
What the blood and stomach pills?!

257
00:22:53,892 --> 00:22:56,052
OUT!

258
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:10,912
It's a lesson to all of us.

259
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:17,432
If anybody needed a lesson, it's you.
But what, particularly,
is the lesson for US?

260
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:22,932
Coggie. He's just sitting there.
And that's on his day off.

261
00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:27,952
I suppose the rest of his week
is equally unexciting.

262
00:23:27,952 --> 00:23:32,112
You can get used to unexciting.
Well, we shouldn't.

263
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:37,492
We should make a vow here and now
never to settle for unexciting.

264
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:42,232
Life after the former Mrs Truelove
has been unexciting.

265
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:46,312
I still think
she's got my spare handcuffs.

266
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:55,192
He were always such a lively lad.
You can't expect him to be still
sitting on Doreen Patterson.

267
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:59,212
Why not?
That's the trouble with growing up.

268
00:23:59,212 --> 00:24:04,312
What do YOU know about growing up?
You never made it. And I never will.

269
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:09,392
You've got to keep accepting
life's challenges. Or else...

270
00:24:09,392 --> 00:24:11,432
Or else what?

271
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:13,412
Coggie.

272
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:23,752
BANG!

273
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:31,292
METALLIC SPLUTTERING
What was that?! I don't know, but
I hope it's never widely available.

274
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:35,332
It sounds like
a couple of chain saws mating.

275
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:39,592
Enough's enough! That's it!
Finished! Done!

276
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:46,452
I don't care what she says!
I'm going back to housework!
I'll find something!

277
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:50,972
Howard, what's tha doing?!
I've been helping Wesley.

278
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:55,012
That explains it.
..Of course, he could be lying.

279
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:57,472
Where are you going?!

280
00:24:57,472 --> 00:25:00,192
Home! To do a bit of housework!

281
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:02,912
I thought you'd done it all!

282
00:25:02,912 --> 00:25:05,412
I'll do it again!

283
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:10,072
How do, lads!
I'm looking for a volunteer.

284
00:25:11,632 --> 00:25:13,612
I'll volunteer.

285
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:21,112
You don't even know what it is!
I'm not going to end up like Coggie.

286
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:23,692
What IS your new machine, Wesley?

287
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:27,992
It's a gem, lads.
It's something I'm REALLY proud of.

288
00:25:27,992 --> 00:25:31,632
An 'eavy-duty garden sucker/blower.

289
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:37,212
I can do that. I can handle
a heavy-duty sucker/blower.

290
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:41,412
Handle one?
You once nearly married one.

291
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:47,352
It's a bit hefty, Wesley.
You'll get used to it.

292
00:25:47,352 --> 00:25:50,412
I told you - it's heavy duty.

293
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:56,512
How many leaves do you want?
That should do her.

294
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:58,992
Should make a mouthful for her.

295
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:08,392
Remember Pearl Harbor.
You're right. He'd be ideal
for dropping on a battleship.

296
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:10,612
Right.

297
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:20,612
Right, I'll start her,
and when you're ready for vacuuming,
you just press that switch.

298
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:25,632
MOTOR COUGHS AND CHUGS

299
00:26:28,312 --> 00:26:30,792
Right, switch her on!

300
00:26:40,352 --> 00:26:42,832
She's a little cracker!

301
00:26:42,832 --> 00:26:49,392
OK. Now we'll try how she blows.
We're not picking up
all those leaves again.

302
00:26:49,392 --> 00:26:52,452
No problem.
We'll try somewhere else.

303
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:59,632
That's right. ..Hey, there's a man
going in your house.

304
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:04,012
Oh, it's all right.
I think it's one of ours. ..Oi!

305
00:27:06,072 --> 00:27:08,672
You can get that lot off out here!

306
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:15,792
You're not going indoors like that!
Did you come straight home?
Of course I came straight home!

307
00:27:36,432 --> 00:27:40,872
All right, lads, let's try it here.
This is good.

308
00:27:40,872 --> 00:27:43,392
Right. Switch it on to blow.

309
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:46,372
SUCKER/BLOWER ROARS

310
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:51,832
AA-AAGH!!

311
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:57,032
I must send the former Mrs Truelove
one of those.

312
00:27:57,032 --> 00:28:00,452
I bet you'd take her back. Never.

313
00:28:00,452 --> 00:28:07,452
Not unless we shared the ironing.
I know I'm being hard,
but I've had to become like that.

314
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:11,552
Only half the ironing?
Now, that's REALLY hard.

315
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:17,292
A man of granite,
is Truly of the Yard.
Of course, he could be lying.
