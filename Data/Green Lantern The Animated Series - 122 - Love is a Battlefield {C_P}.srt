2
00:00:07,786 --> 00:00:10,515
Now let's destroy the rest of these
Manhunters and get out of here!

3
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:11,960
You will not harm them.

4
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:15,541
They function without
emotion, as I do now.

5
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,784
I shall be their Queen.

8
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:30,202
Sisters, look!

9
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:40,031
Invasion!

10
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:15,272
Manhunters here?

11
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,383
No man escapes
the Manhunters.

12
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:39,888
I am no man. I am Aga'po,
Queen of the Zamarons!

13
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:46,606
As soon as the scanners locate Aya, we'll
set a course directly for her coordinates.

14
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:50,031
- If we find her.
- What's that supposed to mean?

15
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:53,790
Hey. Look. I love your cockeyed
optimism, but she was our nav computer.

16
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,516
All the stuff we need to find her
we can't do so well without her.

17
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,595
Aya needs our help
more than ever.

18
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,588
She's confused,
and her processors are misfiring.

19
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,623
Confused? We wish.

20
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,494
Going off the deep end and plugging
into that invincible Antimonitor body?

21
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:10,650
We'll be probably
be saving folks <i>from</i> her.

22
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,343
Aya has helped pull our fat
from the fire plenty of times.

23
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:15,336
Now we're gonna
return the favor.

24
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:17,605
If only we knew
where she was.

25
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:40,230
Star Sapphires of Zamaron, I demand
an audience with your Queen.

26
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:43,660
You are the robot
that served the Green Lanterns.

27
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,704
Why have you come
here making war?

28
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:49,514
I have gained the understanding
that the emotion you serve, love,

29
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:51,744
is not only useless,
but destructive.

30
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:56,950
Love does not destroy. It sustains
and strengthens all who feel it.

31
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:58,486
That is a lie.

32
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,056
I loved and was loved only
to have that love retracted,

33
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:04,158
leaving me nothing but pain.

34
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,627
You, a machine?

35
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:10,998
A truly living being would trust
that love will always prevail.

36
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:16,271
Negative. I am here to punish you
for cultivating this corrosive force.

37
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:19,642
How dare you insult all
we stand for, intruder?

38
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:36,494
I hope that you are finished
with your futile resistance.

39
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:40,131
Our Queen needs medical care.
Please let us take her to the infirmary.

40
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:45,369
You may try and save her, but it is for
nothing, just as love is for nothing.

41
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:48,706
The best way to find Aya
is to get to Oa and scan from there.

42
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:50,541
We're two months from Oa.

43
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:53,978
Sure. At regular speed, but
an ultra-warp... 10 minutes tops,

44
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:55,480
if we don't stop for coffee.

45
00:03:55,548 --> 00:03:59,077
Ultra-warp without a nav A.I.?
Way to risky.

46
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,921
One tiny rounding error,

47
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,756
and we end up smack dab inside
the molten core of a planet.

48
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:08,108
But if you're right about how volatile
Aya is, we have no choice.

49
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:10,244
Why do you want
to destroy us?

50
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:13,232
Yes, we serve love because
love is the one thing

51
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,802
that will eventually bring peace
and harmony to the Universe.

52
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,239
If you had ever felt love,
you would know you are wrong.

53
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:22,908
I have loved, I do love.

54
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,744
Who do you love that you
are so sure of this?

55
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:28,581
I love Hal Jordan of Earth.

56
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,888
And who does he love?

57
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:34,078
He loves another.

58
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:37,387
So your love has brought
you nothing but pain.

59
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:40,393
Yes. I mean, no.

60
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:43,696
How will that pain bring
peace to the Universe?

61
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:46,099
It will... I cannot say.

62
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,918
You have dedicated your life,
your entire planet's purpose

63
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:52,705
to something
you cannot explain.

64
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,777
We gained our understanding of love
from a teacher who is not on Zamaron.

65
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:03,783
- Then bring this teacher here.
- Impossible. She is half a Universe away.

66
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,686
Teleport her with your
crystalline apparatus.

67
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:08,054
We cannot.

68
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:11,357
The portal reunites beings
that share a love between them.

69
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:13,960
It cannot bring one
without the other.

70
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:18,598
Your supposition and technology
are respectively wrong and primitive.

71
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:48,523
Oh, not again...

72
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:53,172
Will this take long?
The buffet closes in 5 minutes.

73
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,505
Carol Ferris, I am sorry
you were taken so abruptly

74
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:58,769
and in the middle of
such important matters.

75
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:03,783
It was not our choice.
You were brought here by this Aya.

76
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,585
Right...

77
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:10,189
Aya comes to us for answers about love,
so I thought it best you speak to her.

78
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:12,525
Well, of course it...
Wait. What now?

79
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:15,226
Carol Ferris of Earth,
can you convince me

80
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:18,464
that the Zamarons and love
should not be destroyed?

81
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:22,702
Well, I... Wait. Destroyed?
Wait. You want to destroy love?

82
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,068
I will destroy love's proxy
in the Universe,

83
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:29,376
the Zamaron home world, unless
you can give me a reason not to.

84
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:34,648
Oh. So no pressure then.
Well, um, I don't know.

85
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:39,152
Love is a battlefield,
love is patient, love is kind.

86
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,690
My love was unkind. He offered
his love, then took it back.

87
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:48,561
Oh. Uh, OK. Well, it is not proud.
It is not easily angered.

88
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:52,976
False. When love is revoked,
it creates anger and resentment.

89
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:59,439
- Carol, tell Aya what you told me.
- I don't know!

90
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:05,517
OK. All I said is that love is about
doing what's best for the one your love.

91
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:10,306
It's as simple as putting his or her needs
before your own, but I'm no expert.

92
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:14,989
- I'm just someone who fell in love.
- Whom did you love?

93
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:19,094
I loved Hal Jordan...
Love Hal Jordan.

94
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:20,762
I guess that's the hard part.

95
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,033
I'll always love him, even
though he makes me so angry.

96
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:28,870
Then you hate and love the
same person simultaneously.

97
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:31,121
I could never hate Hal.

98
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:35,444
He may drive me crazy, but
he'll always have a place in my heart.

99
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:39,115
So you posit that love
is stronger than hate.

100
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:42,919
- Of course.
- Excellent. We shall see.

101
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:46,255
There shall be a trial by
combat between love and hate.

102
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:52,428
- Emotions can't really fight each other.
- Negative. I will force them to.

103
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:01,537
All right. Looks like
we're ready for ultra-warp.

104
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:04,693
Aya makes those calculations
in a fraction of a second.

105
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:07,176
Raze has been working
on that for 3 hours.

106
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:10,280
I'm reasonably sure
I addressed all of the variables.

107
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:14,184
Oh, as long as you're <i>reasonably sure</i>...
Jordan, look at this map.

108
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:17,521
There are 50 near misses
in the anders nebula alone.

109
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:21,125
No human brain can react fast enough
to get through that alive.

110
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:24,508
Flying is mostly instinct.
There's no brain involved.

111
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:28,498
- You know what I mean.
- It's worth it if it gets us to Aya.

112
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:31,601
Razer's right.
She needs our help now.

113
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,442
In 3, 2, 1, and power.

114
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:48,257
How exactly are you gonna make
love and hate fight each other?

115
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,434
I will summon
hate's champion.

116
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,428
Who freed me from my cell?

117
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:02,996
A Green Lantern?

118
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,968
Not quite.

119
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:13,346
Atrocitus of the Red Lanterns,
you are here to represent hate

120
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:16,073
in a fight to the death
against love's champion,

121
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:17,608
Carol Ferris of Earth.

122
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:20,134
No! Carol Ferris
is an innocent.

123
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:22,612
Please let me be
love's champion.

124
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,950
You yourself said Carol Ferris possesses
the greatest understanding of love.

125
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,518
She is chosen.

126
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:31,521
And why should I agree
to this melee?

127
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:35,012
Should you win, the prize
is your freedom and the death

128
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:39,452
of your opponent Hal Jordan's
one true love, Carol Ferris.

129
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,433
That is acceptable.

130
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,494
Wait. This is nuts!
I can't fight an alien warlord.

131
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:51,241
Are those serrated teeth?

132
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:57,413
Here. The Star Sapphire Ring
you returned before.

133
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:59,528
Right. Because if I'm gonna
be battling to the death,

134
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:02,059
I should at least be
well-accessorized.

135
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,751
Of course
the fight must be fair.

136
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,667
Atrocitus should have
his Power Ring, as well.

137
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:43,860
Are you insane?
How is that fair?

138
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:51,468
Coming out of ultra-warp
in 3, 2, 1.

139
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,476
Did this figure into
your calculations?

140
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:02,113
We've jumped right into
the atmosphere of a star.

141
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,881
I see that.

142
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:25,001
One half a degree,
and we'd have been vaporized.

143
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:28,305
But instead we're alive, and
we're that much closer to Oa.

144
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:30,878
- Next time, we'll just remember to...
- Next time?!

145
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:33,430
Uh-uh. We're never
doing that again.

146
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:47,487
Aya, I am not the champion of love.
Please call this off!

147
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:50,123
Fight or die.

148
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:10,350
Unimpressive.

149
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:18,819
Think, Carol, think!

150
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:37,112
I can't do this, I can't!

151
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,148
Wait. The Star Sapphire's
special power.

152
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:42,219
Bring me the one I love.

153
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:52,035
Carol!

154
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:55,064
<i>Atrocitus!</i>

155
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:56,966
Jordan, wait!

156
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:28,117
Only the strength of love
could bring Carol Ferris a hero.

157
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,669
Hal Jordan, please be safe.

158
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:36,365
- Do you know what the heck that was?
- He's been transported to Zamaron.

159
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:41,211
Then we got to high-tail it there.
Atrocitus was waiting for him, Atrocitus!

160
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,077
Zamaron is in Frontier Space.
We'd have to use ultra-warp.

161
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,717
Then let's go.

162
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:09,127
When last we met, human,
I had just conquered Oa.

163
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:13,108
This time, you find
me better rested.

164
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:44,562
The Star Sapphire Ring doesn't let you
drag just anyone across the Universe.

165
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:46,567
It was either you
or my high-school prom date,

166
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:48,610
And he's an accountant
in Tucson.

167
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:04,967
Carol!

168
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:22,411
No!

169
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,710
Ghiata, no.

170
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:35,303
This wasn't your fight.

171
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:41,755
Your mate is next.

172
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:06,019
I've had just about enough of you!
You are done, over!

173
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,831
Ghiata, you shouldn't have.

174
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:41,515
There is no greater privilege than
to perform a deed born of pure love

175
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:49,790
and no greater honor than
that it should be my last.

176
00:16:55,237 --> 00:16:59,573
There is your proof that love
is the strongest force in the Universe.

177
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:02,177
Only love could cause
beings to put themselves

178
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:04,269
so completely
in harm's way,

179
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,932
and then make the ultimate sacrifice:
one's life.

180
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,859
I am comforted that Ghiata
did not die in vain.

181
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:25,632
She proved love is superior and
saved our planet from destruction.

182
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:28,390
We owe her our lives.

183
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:31,568
Love is not superior.

184
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:34,266
But I represented love,

185
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:36,802
and I am not the one smashed
under a rock right now.

186
00:17:36,827 --> 00:17:38,784
I won, we won.

187
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:41,146
No. Atrocitus lost.

188
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:44,149
He and his ring shall be sent
back from where they came.

189
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:46,719
<i>His failure is unacceptable.</i>

190
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:09,841
Aya, please listen to me.

191
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:12,677
Just stop and consider
everything that's happened here.

192
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:15,206
I... we would like to help you.

193
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:18,554
This trial demonstrated
that love causes only pain.

194
00:18:18,593 --> 00:18:21,720
It foolishly led Ghiata
to her own destruction.

195
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:25,825
No. It led her to an act
of total selflessness.

196
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:27,761
All life is pain.

197
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:31,122
I now understand that the best thing
I can do for the Universe

198
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:32,846
is to eliminate all life

199
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:36,670
and replace it with emotionless
machines like my loyal Manhunters.

200
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:38,785
What?! Aya, that's crazy.

201
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:41,454
You fought alongside me
against the same enemies.

202
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:44,067
You were as alive as I am,
and now...

203
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:47,309
Prepare for the total annihilation
of Zamaron.

204
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:55,589
No, Aya.
I won't let you do this.

205
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,831
I do not recall
giving you a choice.

206
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:20,881
Aya!

207
00:19:28,523 --> 00:19:31,626
Aya, what are you doing?

208
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:39,211
To destroy life a single planet
at a time is illogical and inefficient.

209
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:42,573
I will find a way to erase all
life in one motion

210
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:48,152
and remake the entire Universe
in my own image, free of all emotion.

211
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:08,963
Carol Ferris, and Hal Jordan,
you have saved us from destruction.

212
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:11,499
We are forever grateful.

213
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:16,638
I only wish we could have saved Ghiata.
She is a true hero.

214
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:19,141
We'll keep her in our hearts.

215
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,279
The last time you were here,

216
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:25,574
you returned the Star Sapphire Ring,
and this time?

217
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:31,320
I think I'll keep it.

218
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:33,854
You never know when
it might come in handy.

219
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:36,690
You honor us by doing so.

220
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:44,632
So...

221
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:50,923
Thanks for being there
when I called, Hal.

222
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,776
I'll be seeing you around...
The galaxy.

223
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:01,745
