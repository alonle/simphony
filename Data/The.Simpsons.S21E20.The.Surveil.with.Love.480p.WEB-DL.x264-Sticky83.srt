1
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:04,930
There are so many things in
life that I have control over.

2
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,800
What music I listen to.

3
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:09,835
How fast I drive.

4
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:12,771
What dress I wear.

5
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:21,647
I can walk down the street and
control who I choose to look at,

6
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:24,850
who I find attractive,
or who I talk to.

7
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:32,658
But what can't
be controlled is love.

8
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,929
Who I fall in love with,
who falls in love with me...

9
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,932
Or if anyone falls
in love with me.

10
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,176
Every person that I pass on
the street could be the one,

11
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:55,280
the one that will
sweep me off my feet.

12
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,682
And every person that passes

13
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,551
takes with them a
missed opportunity,

14
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,421
and the happiness
that only love brings.

15
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,798
The only true happiness
is found in something

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,668
that I can't control.

17
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,938
Love.

18
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,941
The irony kind
of pisses me off.

19
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,687
Not bad.

20
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,855
Not great...

21
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,490
But not bad.

22
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,962
That's better.

23
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:48,267
However, that all changed when
I met the man of my dreams..

24
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,571
Norman.

25
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:57,843
It's simply not possible,

26
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,444
There's not a commercial
space in this city

27
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,247
that's over twenty years
old that doesn't have

28
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,948
some sort of code violation.

29
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,584
Tell the inspector
we'll pay cash.

30
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,319
That's called bribery.

31
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:11,356
Is that a felony or just
a simple misdemeanor?

32
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,259
Every code in the
city is cash driven!

33
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,995
Tell him to put it in
escrow or we're moving on.

34
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:20,732
Mr. Molino has made it
perfectly clear he's not in love

35
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,368
with the asking until he gets
an independent inspection.

36
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,904
He wants to shave
thirty percent off.

37
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:29,508
Tell him we'll cut him in
on the Ross-Feinman deal

38
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,510
and then we'll see
what he has to say

39
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,011
about the codes.

40
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,481
How are you in on Ross-Feinman?

41
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,818
Wants to know what time you're
picking her up for dinner.

42
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,620
And don't say you forgot.

43
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,456
I confirmed your reservations
with you yesterday.

44
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,392
I didn't forget about Dori,
I forgot about Cara.

45
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,362
I'm supposed to go
to some bullshit art opening

46
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,430
with her tonight.

47
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,831
Cara's still in the picture?

48
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,934
Yeah. It's complicated.

49
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,370
Can you tell Dori,
I'm in a meeting-

50
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,038
That only works so many times.

51
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,673
And how many times
have I used it?

52
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,410
'So many.' She's on line three.

53
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,681
I'm sorry about this gentlemen.

54
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,551
I've got to take this call.

55
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,790
Hello?

56
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,525
Are you ready for tonight?

57
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,427
Dori. Hi.

58
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,662
Uh, oh. Something's amiss.

59
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,597
I can tell by your voice.

60
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,865
There's nothing going on.

61
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,634
You're flaking on me again.

62
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,435
No, no, no... Of course not.

63
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,870
Well, yeah. I sort of am.

64
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,071
There's a big deal
closing and I'm not sure

65
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,540
what time
I'm getting outta here.

66
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,009
How about we just
do a mellow dinner?

67
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:37,976
Get take out.

68
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,811
And if you need to
take a call, then fine,

69
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,080
you need to take a call.

70
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,416
It'd be nice to
see you, that's all.

71
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,385
I really want to see you too.

72
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,053
Really?

73
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,921
Of course.

74
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,991
Of course.
Listen, I have to go.

75
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,595
Tell you what.
I officially owe you one.

76
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:57,763
I'll call you in a few days

77
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:02,100
and we can get
together then, alright?

78
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,469
Okay.

79
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,572
Okay. See you soon.

80
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:21,687
It's a little dicey around
four-thirty, you know?

81
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:26,024
You figure out
the whole Dori thing?

82
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,993
What? What?

83
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,661
How long have you
been with her?

84
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,630
Two months?

85
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,899
First of all,
I am not with anyone.

86
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,001
However, Dori and
I have been passing time

87
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,536
for the last four weeks.

88
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:38,937
Oh that's nice.

89
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,974
And how long have you been
'passing time' with Cara?

90
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,876
Cara and I broke up eons ago.

91
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,412
Oh, right, I forgot.

92
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:51,483
You're just screwing Cara to
her to help her get over you?

93
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:54,486
Why are you busting my balls?

94
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,022
Norman...

95
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,726
You have to start
thinking like a big boy.

96
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,695
Look... Dori's happy.

97
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,497
Cara's happy. I'm happy.

98
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,965
You're the only one
that's not happy.

99
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,034
Come on...
Feel 'the happy', man.

100
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,671
I'm just saying...

101
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:13,939
Dori, hi.

102
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,108
Another complication.

103
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,509
I'm sorry for bugging you.

104
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,945
I was just thinking that maybe,

105
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,748
after your deal closes,
that you might want to-

106
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,150
if you're not too tired,
maybe you'd want to come over

107
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:28,787
and celebrate?

108
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,890
I'll wear that little red
thing that you like so much.

109
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:49,141
I think I may have
tweaked my hip flexor.

110
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:52,244
Well, I'll just have
to be on top next time.

111
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,951
Finding you has been...

112
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,187
such a relief.

113
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,093
Too much wine.

114
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,861
What is it that you always say?

115
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,532
The more drunk I get the
better looking you get?

116
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,701
That's it.

117
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,204
I certainly don't
need to be drunk.

118
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:22,007
You could use a
couple of shots though.

119
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,975
Come on, Dori.
Don't sell yourself short.

120
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,577
You're beautiful.

121
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,711
Do you really mean that?

122
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,781
Of course.

123
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,818
Look into my eyes and
tell me I'm beautiful.

124
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,258
You guys are both beautiful.

125
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,562
What am I going to do with you?

126
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,868
Let's go away up north.
Just you and me.

127
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,070
My Grandpa Ed has a place
in the mountains.

128
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,239
He never uses it.

129
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:57,275
I wish I could, but I can't.

130
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,878
Oh... Come on. It'll be fun.

131
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,113
It's in the middle of nowhere.

132
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:05,283
It'll be a great escape
from all the hustle and bustle.

133
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,652
I'd never be able
to take the time off work.

134
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,287
You own the company.

135
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,724
You can take all
the time off you want.

136
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,326
It sounds really good.

137
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,028
But I have two deals
closing this weekend.

138
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,566
Maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

139
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,602
I'm asking you nicely.

140
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:27,272
Would you please come
away up North with me?

141
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:30,709
Maybe we should take a
little time to think about this?

142
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,811
Please?

143
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:48,360
Please, please, pretty please?

144
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,795
With Dori on top?

145
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,731
Wow!

146
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,301
Please?

147
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,338
Romeo?

148
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,941
You know you can't go
away for a week with her.

149
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,377
It's not a week.
It's a long weekend.

150
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,846
You really drink that stuff?

151
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,115
You can't really be this naive.

152
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,716
What?

153
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,352
Dori thinks
she's your girlfriend.

154
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,855
I guarantee that she's
telling all her gal pals

155
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:20,325
about how her great new
boyfriend is so special

156
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:24,029
and she maybe
has found Mr. Right.

157
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,363
Dori's not like that.

158
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,098
She's well travelled.

159
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,833
International.

160
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,268
I've never said
anything to indicate that

161
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,970
this relationship is serious.

162
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,705
You said you'd
go away with her.

163
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,273
That's saying it.

164
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,212
Seriously? There is a
coffee maker over there.

165
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,114
We don't have soy.

166
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,152
Look. Some people
like to lease cars

167
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,386
and some people
like to buy them.

168
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,388
And my lease with Dori
is up in a few weeks.

169
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,390
I wash my hands
clean of all this.

170
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,459
Oh shit, I forgot to call Cara.

171
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,732
Are those really real?

172
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,301
So now do you think I should
give up like you did?

173
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,869
I didn't think so.

174
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,271
Hey... I'm a
happily married man.

175
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,305
Really?

176
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,807
Are you really happily married?

177
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,709
Because I have never met
a happily married couple.

178
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:14,279
My folks being at
the top of that list.

179
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,280
Cara!

180
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,815
Hi!

181
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,817
You did?

182
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,952
That is so funny.

183
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,320
You're wrong.

184
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,422
About the coffee.

185
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,081
God I just love this song.

186
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,149
It's so romantic.
Don't you think?

187
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,351
My heart is floating.

188
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,020
I'm surprised such
an expensive car

189
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,287
doesn't have one of
these things built into it.

190
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,124
It's not a car. It's a Porsche.

191
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,292
That is so typical of a man.

192
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,327
What is?

193
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,095
Drooling over a car.

194
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,163
Sorry. Sorry.

195
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,432
- A Porsche.
- Thank you.

196
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,367
I'm reading this book

197
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,902
called 'The Twelve Steps
to a Happy New Year.'

198
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,003
Of course you are.

199
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,304
What?

200
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,273
He's a really smart guy.

201
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,342
Dr. Fisher says that 'Men
have a more difficult time

202
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,144
expressing their emotions
than women do.'

203
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:22,380
You mean we don't
cry all the time.

204
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,483
I can try and make
you cry if you want?

205
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,888
So rather than expressing
their emotions to a person,

206
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,289
they'll express them
to something else.

207
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,425
A sports team, a stereo...

208
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,160
A car...

209
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,163
Something that
can't respond back.

210
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,331
So it's a woman's responsibility
in a relationship

211
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,802
to show the man how to get
in touch with his emotions.

212
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,073
Dr. Fisher calls it
"Guerrilla Training."

213
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,374
It's a really good book.

214
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,309
Okay.

215
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,812
Norman, relax.

216
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,147
You have nothing to
worry about with me.

217
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,253
So do you want to listen
to our song one more time?

218
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,355
Knock yourself out.

219
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,207
Come on. Hurry.

220
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,209
Hey?

221
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,311
Wait up.

222
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,487
You gotta see this.

223
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,133
See what?

224
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,501
Shh.

225
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,236
Isn't it beautiful?

226
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,404
Look at it.

227
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,840
Yeah.

228
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,209
When I was little I used to

229
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,880
imagine that...

230
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,916
all my fears were
in the belly of the sun

231
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,018
and when the sun
would finally go down,

232
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,121
my fears would go down with it.

233
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,591
Do you know what
I was afraid of?

234
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,393
No.

235
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,495
Being alone.

236
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,416
I love this place.

237
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,884
I used to come
here for the summer

238
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,553
with my Grandpa Ed.

239
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,022
He has a soft serve ice
cream machine out in back

240
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,491
and we would sit
on the front porch

241
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:50,295
and eat ice cream
cones all day.

242
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,430
What's your flavor?

243
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,998
Ohh, I don't know.

244
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,200
Mint chip, maybe.

245
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:58,203
You don't look like
a mint chipper.

246
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,004
What am I then?

247
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,174
You're more of a Pralines
and Cream type person.

248
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,944
Pralines and Cream...

249
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,412
I think they're sexy.

250
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:10,081
It's not bad.

251
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,184
Rub your fingers
through my hair.

252
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,490
That feels good.

253
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,129
Do you know what today is?

254
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,332
Friday.

255
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,533
Funny.

256
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,269
It's our anniversary.

257
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,505
Our anniversary?

258
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,541
It was two months ago
today that you hired me.

259
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,211
And as I recall, just three
days later that you...

260
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,346
fired me.

261
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,581
And fire you I did. Twice.

262
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,218
You violated some
federal labor law I think.

263
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,321
I think I violated
more than that.

264
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,960
Two whole months!

265
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:59,163
You know, 'The Twelve Steps
to a Happy New Year'...

266
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,432
It says that if you can make it
through all of the holidays

267
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,968
with someone
you've found your mate.

268
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,004
Really?

269
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,705
Yup.

270
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,041
And if you can survive
New Year's Eve

271
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,110
then that says it all.

272
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,615
That Dr. Fisher. I tell ya.

273
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,984
We've only got Groundhog
Day under our belt.

274
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,653
President's Day, too, I think.

275
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:23,488
That doesn't really
count, though.

276
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,291
Father's Day is coming up.

277
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,760
Ooh, it's been a long,
long day.

278
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,396
We should hit the-

279
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,364
It's late. We should?

280
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:36,000
How do you feel?

281
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,735
I feel?

282
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:41,139
A little bloated
from the pasta...

283
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,274
I'm not really an Alfredo guy.

284
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,710
No. I mean about me? About us?

285
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,151
You feel our connection, right?

286
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,286
You know, it's hard for me
to think that I'd be here

287
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,689
if we didn't have
some sort of connection.

288
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,757
Yeah. Some feeling,
somewhere. Right?

289
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,295
I mean, we have fun together
and you make me laugh.

290
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,396
Make you laugh?

291
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,231
Yeah. You make me laugh.

292
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,334
Is that so wrong?
Is that so bad?

293
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,370
Make you laugh how?

294
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:15,707
I dunno. Like 'Hardy har har.'

295
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,343
Well then laugh it up,
Mr. Backer! Laugh it up!

296
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,211
I'll show you who's
the funny one around here.

297
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,313
Who's laughing now, huh?

298
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,415
What's so funny now?

299
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,086
I'll teach you to mess with me.

300
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,254
Guerrilla training my ass!

301
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,322
I am Kong.

302
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,424
I love you.

303
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,595
I can't believe
I just said that.

304
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,530
But I do. I said it.

305
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,866
I love you! I love you!

306
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,874
I love you, Norman.

307
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,750
You're not going
to say it back?

308
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,789
We've had a lot to drink.

309
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,358
Ah come on,
where are you going?

310
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,494
I shouldn't have said it!

311
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,096
I'm such an idiot!

312
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,432
Listen, you're over reacting.

313
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,134
It's no big deal
that you said that.

314
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,268
No big deal?

315
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,636
A woman tells you
that she loves you

316
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:19,838
and you say it's "no big deal"?

317
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,708
Listen, I'm just saying
I'm alright with you saying it.

318
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,810
I'm okay that you said it.

319
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,147
So you're okay that I love you?

320
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,785
If you're okay with it
and just having a hard time

321
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,186
telling me, that's okay.

322
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,288
I can help you.

323
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,260
I want you to look deep within
yourself when I ask you this.

324
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,695
Okay?

325
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,531
Do you love me?

326
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,802
Come on...

327
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,804
Oh my God! What is my problem?

328
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,405
Why do I keep doing
this to myself?

329
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,406
Why?! You know what?

330
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,507
Forget what I said
about loving you.

331
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,576
Forget it!

332
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,144
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to bed!

333
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,913
Dori, let's not get
all crazy, alright?

334
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,681
Your bedroom is upstairs,
down the hall!

335
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:07,885
The sheets are in the wash!
Happy anniversary, asshole!

336
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,462
Holy fucking shit.

337
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,525
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

338
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,561
Did you sleep okay?

339
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,596
Yeah, I suppose. Considering.

340
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,632
Sorry, you won't find any
reception way out here.

341
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,468
Have a seat.
Breakfast is almost ready.

342
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,304
What kind of juice
do you like? Apple or orange?

343
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,273
Whichever is fine.

344
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,808
Orange it is.

345
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,712
Uh oh... are you still
upset about last night?

346
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,614
Yeah. I'd rather
just forget about it.

347
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,882
It never happened.

348
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,450
Oh, we need to talk about it.

349
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,952
It was our first argument
and how we handle it

350
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,388
will set the foundation
for our relationship.

351
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,523
It's critical we deal
with this carefully.

352
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,325
Now, I think we can
both agree that alcohol

353
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,627
played a big roll
in our actions.

354
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,996
However, I, for one,
am not going to use

355
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,531
that as an excuse.

356
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,401
Albert! Play nicely with Dolly!

357
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,269
So, with that said, Norman,

358
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:08,372
I am really sorry for
what happened last night.

359
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,343
That felt better.

360
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,744
How about you?

361
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,585
Dori, what's the
deal with the kids?

362
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,589
My eggs! I hope you're hungry.

363
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,891
I've fixed my world
famous Denver omelette.

364
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,359
To be honest,
it's not really mine.

365
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,360
It's my Grandpa Ed's...

366
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,395
It's a secret family recipe.

367
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,997
Oh, what the hell,
I can tell you.

368
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,967
I use Canadian bacon
instead of ham.

369
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,002
Albert!

370
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,704
Stop riling up your sister.

371
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,339
You know she's got asthma!

372
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,908
I find Canadian bacon holds
its flavor better than ham.

373
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,643
Here. Take a bite.

374
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:48,446
I'm anxious to see
what you think.

375
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:52,383
This is not really
the weekend I had in mind.

376
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,385
Let's not forget
our manners, Norman.

377
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,721
Those kids...
They don't have a father.

378
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,389
I figured it would be nice
to bring them up here

379
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,624
so they can enjoy the place.

380
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,992
That's very charitable of you,

381
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:03,327
but did you have
to pick this weekend?

382
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,795
- You've got a little something.
- - Jesus, Dori. Listen.

383
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,397
I gave up a lot to be here.

384
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,532
The least you could do is
tell me we'd be babysitting

385
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,635
someone's kids.

386
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,739
Hey Mom, when's breakfast?

387
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,841
It's ready. Go wash up.

388
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,047
Aren't they adorable?

389
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,017
Mommy! Albert is playing
with his food.

390
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,052
Shut up!

391
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:03,087
Mommy! Albert said a bad word.

392
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,122
"Shut" is not a bad word.
'Shit' is.

393
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,124
Albert, what did I say
about your language?

394
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,727
Now both of you
eat your breakfast.

395
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,595
Hi. I'm Albert.

396
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:12,897
Norman.

397
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,965
Nice to finally meet you.

398
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,837
How are you with percentages?

399
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,005
What?

400
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,973
Do you know your percentages?

401
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:26,510
I'm doing them
in school right now.

402
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,779
Yeah, I know my percentages.

403
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,581
Do you know them,

404
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,617
know them as in 'real world'
application know them?

405
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,422
Be nice, Albert.

406
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:41,025
Mom! I've got
a boatload of homework.

407
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,994
If this guy's shaky on his
percentages then I gotta know.

408
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,166
I told you that
I know my percentages.

409
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,235
What more do you want?

410
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,141
Are you done with
your Denver omelette?

411
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:58,809
Sure.

412
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,978
Isn't Dolly a good girl?

413
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,380
The best.

414
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,916
You know, Mom, this isn't
really a Denver omelets

415
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,952
because you're not using ham.

416
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:10,054
I am using ham,
just not American ham.

417
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,524
I'm using Canadian ham.

418
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:15,192
Where's Canada?

419
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,660
North.

420
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,764
Like by the North Pole?
Next to Santa Claus?

421
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,634
Yeah, sure. Right up
next to Old St. Nick.

422
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,035
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

423
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,104
Dude. You're lying.

424
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,540
What are you talking about?

425
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,975
You know what
I'm talking about?

426
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,510
Santa Claus...

427
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:33,844
What's wrong with Santa Claus?

428
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,946
Norman!

429
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,048
I didn't say anything.

430
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,786
Jesus god?

431
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,057
Why don't you two
go outside and play?

432
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,994
Can we give Norman
his surprises first?

433
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,229
Oh, I suppose we can.

434
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,165
I'll get the balloon
and the presents.

435
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,267
I'm gonna get my special card.

436
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,107
Happy Valentine's Day!

437
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,942
Valentine's Day, Dori?

438
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,110
I know, I know.

439
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,978
A holiday created
by Madison Avenue.

440
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,713
But I can't help myself.

441
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,615
I'm a hopeless romantic.

442
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,221
Don't worry if you forgot.

443
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,126
You wanna go give
Norman his card?

444
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,094
I made this for you in class.

445
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:27,631
And I made this for you with
the help of American Express.

446
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,300
I wanna open it!
No! I wanna open it!

447
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,368
Careful. Careful.

448
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:34,905
Ooo, pretty.

449
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,842
Look Albert, a sparkly bear!

450
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:39,944
It goes right over here.

451
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,250
And I know what
you're thinking...

452
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:47,852
That it's June.

453
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:51,155
But all the men are wearing
these things too now.

454
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,326
They're all the rage.

455
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,294
It's okay. You can go
outside and play now.

456
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,598
Finally. This guy is so boring.

457
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,736
So, what do you think?

458
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,739
I uh... wow! So many questions.

459
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:09,974
What? You don't like the kids?

460
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:11,709
So many questions.

461
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:13,177
I know you might
think this is crazy.

462
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,812
And maybe I went about
introducing them

463
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,213
the wrong way, but...

464
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:19,750
Those are my kids,
and they are part of me.

465
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,619
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner

466
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,655
but I was just afraid
of how you'd react.

467
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,124
Aww, come on. Look at us.

468
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,694
A young couple, nice house,
a couple of kids,

469
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,096
just one thing missing...

470
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:37,601
I got you. You should've
seen your face! Priceless.

471
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:40,638
Boy, you are a nut!
A bona fide nut!

472
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,973
So you'll stay?

473
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,075
Dori. You can't expect me
to get excited about -

474
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,777
excited...

475
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,114
The kids go to bed early.

476
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,715
They do?

477
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,817
Yes. They do.

478
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,321
How early?

479
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,356
Real early.

480
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:00,691
Real early?

481
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:03,727
Real, real, real early.

482
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,634
Dori?

483
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:13,370
Yes?

484
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,673
How did the kids get here?

485
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,911
So this is Grandpa Ed
and Grandma Edna.

486
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,067
Dori says you sell houses.

487
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,268
That's nice.

488
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,170
A realtor? What is that?

489
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,072
A six weeks of school
before they give you

490
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,240
a crappy red jacket?

491
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,376
I have a B.S. in finance.

492
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,178
B.S. is right.

493
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,014
Norman buys homes whose
loans have been defaulted on

494
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,415
then he renovates
before reselling.

495
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,284
It's very profitable.

496
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,922
What do you do with the
family that's defaulted?

497
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:06,924
Um? What?

498
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,360
I mean what do you
with the families

499
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:11,729
that no longer have a home?

500
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,130
Yeah. What do you do with them?

501
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,934
Um, well, that's not
really my responsibility.

502
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:20,804
Making someone homeless
isn't your responsibility?

503
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,940
Well it doesn't
exactly work that way.

504
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:24,475
If you don't have a
home you're homeless.

505
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:27,344
How exactly is it
supposed to work?

506
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,079
You know, Norman, you should
really think about trying

507
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,482
to find these families homes.

508
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,184
Noted.

509
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:38,288
So what are your intentions?

510
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,224
Come again?

511
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,259
Your game plan, son.

512
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:45,362
What the hell's your game
plan when it comes to Dori?

513
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,366
Um, to be honest

514
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:52,202
we're not really
technically boyfriend and...

515
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,139
We just celebrated our
two month anniversary.

516
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,141
Oh! Congratulations!

517
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,109
Anniversaries are such a hoot.

518
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:03,347
So you both are intimate
with each another already.

519
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,182
That's always fun.

520
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,017
Grandma!

521
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:14,358
Dr. Fisher says
that a robust sex life

522
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,295
can lead to a long
and loving relationship.

523
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:21,331
And he wasn't just talking
about heavy petting, neither.

524
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,000
He was talking
about actual penetration

525
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,002
and a whole lot of it.

526
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:28,105
Ed penetrates me all the time.

527
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,345
What the hell
were you thinking?

528
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,780
What I was thinking was
that it would be nice

529
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,015
for you to meet the family.

530
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:39,850
I didn't even know you had
a family until ten minutes ago.

531
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,819
Everybody has a family.
Jesus Christ, Dori.

532
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,954
A relationship is a give
and take proposition.

533
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,422
You can't just have
sex from a woman

534
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,157
and expect to give
something in return.

535
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,460
What on earth are
you talking about?

536
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:51,895
You know very well Albert is
struggling with percentages.

537
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,797
He could use your help.

538
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,299
Oh, you need my math skills?

539
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,835
Listen! Dori,
you're a lovely girl.

540
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,436
And I'm sure you're going to
make someone very happy one day.

541
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,138
But man o' man,
you need some fucking

542
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,673
big time professional help.

543
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:09,346
That song?
It's about a stalker.

544
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:12,149
And Pralines and Cream?
It's disgusting.

545
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:15,319
So have a nice day,
an even better life.

546
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:18,555
I'll see you on the other side.

547
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,224
What the?

548
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,925
What happened
to my steering wheel?

549
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:22,926
What?

550
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,296
What the fuck happened
to my steering wheel?

551
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,464
Your language, Norman.

552
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,933
Where's my fucking
steering wheel!

553
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,236
Oh boy. We have some
degenerate teenagers in town-

554
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,505
You sawed off
my steering wheel!

555
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,206
Are you accusing
me of stealing?

556
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,408
I'm accusing you of
being out of your mind!

557
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,944
You know how much this
is going to cost me?

558
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,447
I'll go find Grandpa, see if he
can give you a ride into town.

559
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,982
There's a general store there.

560
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,483
A general store?

561
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:49,086
This is a fucking Porsche
not a stage coach!

562
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,220
They have lots of stuff.

563
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:53,323
You'd be surprised.

564
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:56,126
'Keep it together.
Where's my phone.

565
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,228
Fuck! My phone's inside'

566
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,907
Oh yes! Yes, yes, yes!

567
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:12,442
Come on?

568
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,510
Okay Andrew, pick up.

569
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,612
Pick up Andrew. Pick up.

570
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,252
Hola, que tal?

571
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,253
Oh thank God.

572
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:26,123
This chick is out of her gourd.

573
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,124
Mom?

574
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,158
Is that you?

575
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,260
Stop fucking around.

576
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,129
It sounds like you're in a well.

577
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,932
More like
another planet. Listen..

578
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:38,101
Dori. She's a
complete whack job.

579
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,537
Oh, Dori, right.
How's that going?

580
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,173
Uh. Well, she's crazy, man.

581
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,409
Are we talking "takes it
in the two-hole" crazy?

582
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,244
Skye, not too far.

583
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:50,147
Or "brings a friend
into bed" crazy?

584
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:53,083
More like sawing off my
steering wheels crazy.

585
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,453
Nah. Can't hear you.

586
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:59,556
Dori thinks today
is Valentine's Day.

587
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,427
Did you say she thinks
today is 'Valentine's Day'?

588
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,929
Yeah. She's got hearts
all over the house.

589
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:06,997
It's June.

590
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,532
That's what I said.

591
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,301
Karma's a bitch

592
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,669
don't say that word, honey.

593
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,538
Yeah, you know what?
Your sympathy is heart-warming.

594
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,440
Well what do you want to hear?

595
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,175
You leave me with all the work.

596
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:19,710
That's not a very
kind thing to do.

597
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:22,179
Oh my god?

598
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,381
Dude, this shit is
getting weirder by the minute.

599
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,383
You gotta get yourself up here.

600
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,585
Eh. Back in the well.
Can't hear ya.

601
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,354
Get yourself up here!

602
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,222
Well where's up here?

603
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,092
Who are you talking to?

604
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:37,661
Just checking
my voice-mail on speaker.

605
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,973
And I can see how
a lot of men can feel...

606
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:51,074
Well... Cramped,

607
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,610
or even trapped,
in a relationship.

608
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,345
I don't blame them.

609
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,481
Some girls, my God,
they expect their boyfriends

610
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:01,051
to give up everything
to be with them.

611
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,086
Not me.

612
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,489
I understand the need
for Saturday night poker

613
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,090
with the guys.

614
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,727
"Don't smother your man",
that's what I always say.

615
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,767
Just let me love you, Norman.

616
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,368
Let us love you.

617
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,770
Is that so hard?

618
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:20,272
Ouch!

619
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,545
That looks like it hurt.

620
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,647
Are you okay?

621
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,417
What the fuck is going on here?

622
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,451
It's Easter!

623
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,253
Don't use that language
in front of the kids.

624
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:38,755
Fuck you and your kids!
Untie my hands.

625
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:40,190
Kids, leave the room.

626
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,291
I wanna watch.

627
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:46,396
Let's go wake up Grandpa up
and find some Easter eggs!

628
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,771
You're getting yourself
into big trouble.

629
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,074
You've gone too far, Dori.

630
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,678
I'm calling the cops.

631
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,846
What are you doing?

632
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,614
Do you know how hard
it is for a woman

633
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,550
with two kids
to meet a decent guy,

634
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:09,152
let alone have him
fall in love with her?

635
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,355
Try E-fucking-Harmony.

636
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,556
When a guy first meets a girl

637
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,193
he's all, 'You're so
beautiful, la, la, la.'

638
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:18,528
Then the girl gets
excited and thinks,

639
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,132
'He might be the
one, la, la, la.'

640
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,167
Then she lets her guard
down, invites him in,

641
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,702
cooks for him, cleans for him,

642
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:30,440
swallows for him, la, la, la.

643
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,843
Then he sees the kids and POOF!

644
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:33,844
He's gone.

645
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,213
La. La. La.

646
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,448
You never even told
me you had kids.

647
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,450
Had I told you then you
would have never said 'yes'

648
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:43,653
to coming up here, right?

649
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,756
That's what I thought.

650
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:52,195
See, the problem with men is
that they tend to react more

651
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,731
to the situation
rather than the person.

652
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,833
You should fall in love
with the person regardless

653
00:33:56,835 --> 00:34:00,337
of the situation.

654
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,206
Now, you might be
asking yourself,

655
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,209
'How do I get to know someone?'

656
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,344
Good question.

657
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:10,447
That's where
Dr. Fisher comes in.

658
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,450
In 'The Twelve Steps to a
Happy New Year' he says that...

659
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:15,218
'Different holidays naturally

660
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,320
evoke different
emotions in people.

661
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:19,623
It's important to experience
all of those emotions

662
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:22,459
in order to really
get to know someone.'

663
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:32,269
Now obviously you're not a
big fan of Valentine's Day...

664
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,372
But what's not to
love about Easter?

665
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,645
Enough is enough!

666
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,780
This is insane!

667
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,583
Is he ready? Can we come in?

668
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,785
Okay kids. It's time.

669
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,387
Oh yeah?

670
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,688
There's one!

671
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,824
Here's an orange one!

672
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:55,659
I found it!

673
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,794
No wait. It's mine!

674
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,864
Hey kids, no fighting
on Easter. Alright?

675
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,734
How's he doing?

676
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,704
Needless to say,
the honeymoon's over.

677
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,540
And now the real work begins.

678
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,813
You people need
major fucking help!

679
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,382
Your language, Norman...

680
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,384
My language, Dori? Blow me!

681
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,286
Mom!

682
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,422
Grandpa never asked
if he could use my bat.

683
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:26,723
Now I'm sure
Grandpa didn't mean

684
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,358
to take it without
your permission.

685
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,659
I certainly did not.

686
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,661
And I'm sorry.

687
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:34,764
Oh my goodness.
I almost forgot my pie.

688
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,228
I see snow on the
table, Grandma.

689
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,329
Whoops!

690
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,232
Thank you for reminding
me about my manners, dear.

691
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,001
You're welcome.

692
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:14,804
Dori, what did you do
differently with this chicken?

693
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:15,872
I changed the marinade.

694
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,541
I used lemon and
garlic this time.

695
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:19,876
Oh. It's simply wonderful.

696
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,345
How do you like it, Norman?

697
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,849
So many times I would try
to do something fancy

698
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,952
and I would ruin
the taste of the meat.

699
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,855
I've tasted something
like this before.

700
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,357
But I can't remember when.

701
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:38,328
It was Jackie's seventy
eighth birthday party.

702
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,629
That's right.

703
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,499
The village threw a
party and it was catered.

704
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,768
Chirpin Chicken!

705
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,970
Oh, Ed. Don't be a putz.

706
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:49,072
Chirpin Chicken!?

707
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,680
Are you sure you
don't want anything to eat?

708
00:36:56,682 --> 00:37:00,517
It's organic.

709
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,553
No dinner. No desert.

710
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:09,459
That's right.
No dinner, no dessert.

711
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:12,362
Was it Rhonda's Rotisserie?

712
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:14,464
I don't think so.

713
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:19,536
Mommy, he stuck
his tongue out at me!

714
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:23,940
Now, would you please have
a little something to eat.

715
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:27,377
How can I be expected to eat
if I can't use my hands?

716
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,945
Albert can feed you.

717
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,314
Yeah. Open up.

718
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:32,749
Come on. Open up!

719
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:33,850
I wanna feed him!

720
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,552
No! I get to! Mom!

721
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:36,686
Mom!

722
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,088
Hey, hey - kids!

723
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,324
I know! It was Conrad's
Crispy Catered Chicken.

724
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,393
Conrad died in ninety three.

725
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:45,495
It was ninety five...
I remember.

726
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,598
I wanna feed him!

727
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,599
No! I get to!

728
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,600
- Mom!
- Kids!

729
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,935
I am a grown man.

730
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,770
I refuse to be fed by a child!

731
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:54,804
I remember!

732
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:58,908
It was Billy's Broiled,
Shake and Baked Chicken!

733
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,043
That was it!

734
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:01,444
I remember that.

735
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,848
Dolly's having an attack!
Dolly's having an attack!

736
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,650
Grab her inhaler
in the drawer. Hurry!

737
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:08,551
Hurry Grandpa! Quickly!

738
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:10,654
It's gonna be okay.

739
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,690
It's okay.

740
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:15,825
Here, dear.

741
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,594
It's okay. It's okay.

742
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:19,529
Would you help me
get her ready for bed?

743
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,097
I'll draw her a bath.

744
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,699
It's okay.

745
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,707
It's okay. It's okay.

746
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,483
Here comes the plane.

747
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,751
Open up!

748
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:48,024
- Oh come on...
- It's so good.

749
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,126
Come on! Come on!

750
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,528
Come on!

751
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,836
Who are you people?!

752
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:07,971
You're all crazy!

753
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,510
You're... psychos!

754
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:19,115
Maniacs! All of you!

755
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:22,085
I'm going to have
all of you arrested!

756
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,594
Please? For god sakes,
somebody help me.

757
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,697
I gotta go - I gotta pee?

758
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,172
Thank god...
I gotta take a piss.

759
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:44,073
Who is it? Who's there?
Albert, is that you?

760
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,708
Help me up.

761
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,243
What is wrong with you?

762
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:49,012
The children need their sleep.

763
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:51,114
Now you show
some consideration.

764
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,991
Now go back to sleep.

765
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,967
Morning. Hey hon. Is he up?

766
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,001
Not yet.

767
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,771
I cut the chain to forty feet.

768
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:52,609
Yeah. That feels about right.

769
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:54,410
Eww. Yuck!

770
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,314
Watch it kids.
Norman had an accident.

771
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,884
Ha ha! He wet his pants!

772
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:06,589
Oh good. You're awake.

773
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:08,892
I made breakfast.

774
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:11,261
I can heat some leftovers
up for you if you want.

775
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,298
I'm only going to ask you once.

776
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,401
Do you want breakfast or not?

777
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:20,670
Yes.

778
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:22,872
Yes, what?

779
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,707
Yes, please.

780
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,911
Remember kids.
Always say 'please'

781
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:29,946
Okay!

782
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,881
I think it's Daddy time.

783
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,183
Let's all wish Norman
a happy Father's Day!

784
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,752
Happy Father's Day!

785
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,421
Happy Father's Day!

786
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,191
I wanna play baseball.

787
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:43,993
I wanna play beauty salon.

788
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,061
Remember kids,
this is Daddy's day.

789
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,463
So he gets to do
whatever he wants.

790
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,434
Good. Because I wanna kill
each and every one of you.

791
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:57,106
How about a special
Thanksgiving dinner

792
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,175
to celebrate the occasion?

793
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:01,210
That's a fucking great idea.

794
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,046
Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Father's Day!

795
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,334
Time for daddy to go bye-bye.

796
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,645
I'm scared.

797
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:38,014
Jesus! You scared the shi-

798
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:39,982
You scared me.

799
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:41,450
You're scared too? Good.

800
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:46,055
Help me find Nibbles
and we won't be scared.

801
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:49,025
Nibbles?

802
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:50,459
Nibbles? Who's Nibbles?

803
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:54,130
One of mommy's old
boyfriend's gave him to me.

804
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:56,699
He makes me not so scared.

805
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:58,501
Your mom's boyfriend?

806
00:48:58,503 --> 00:49:01,437
I think his name
was Eric or something.

807
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,373
Who's Eric?
What happened to him?

808
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:07,476
Mom keeps all that
stuff in the closet.

809
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,195
Who does all
this stuff belong to?

810
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:28,297
Other men that
Mom has brought home.

811
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:32,068
She keeps on to find daddies
but they always keep on leaving.

812
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:35,471
One time, told me
that he saw mommy

813
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,807
and this man napping
naked together.

814
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:42,044
And Mommy told me that when
grown-ups nap naked together

815
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:45,181
that means
they love each other.

816
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:48,417
Have you napped
naked with girls?

817
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:50,486
Yeah. I have.

818
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,622
How many times?

819
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:56,726
Let's just say I like
to take a lot of naps.

820
00:49:56,728 --> 00:49:58,494
Look there's Mommy
with white hair.

821
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,629
Doesn't she look pretty.

822
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:02,498
How long ago were these
pictures taken?

823
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,234
I don't know.
I wasn't born yet.

824
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:07,470
She gave all of these men

825
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:11,374
little sparkly
bears like yours.

826
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:12,641
All of them?

827
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:15,711
Yes. She says it's like
giving them her heart.

828
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,683
What happened to them?

829
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,319
I don't know. We always
play the 'voting game'

830
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:26,322
on News Year's Eve.

831
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:27,556
Voting game?

832
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,425
Like Survivor.

833
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:31,694
Have you seen
'The Biggest Loser?'

834
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,230
Those people are so fat!

835
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:35,131
They are?

836
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:39,201
I like fat people.
They're funny.

837
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:42,838
After the voting game,
I think they just go home!

838
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:51,213
Norman? Where are you going?

839
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:53,315
Where are you going, Norman?

840
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,754
Norman, don't leave.

841
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,790
I'm going over here, Dolly.

842
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:02,725
I'm going right
over here, Dolly.

843
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:15,171
Mommy gets really sad
when the men leave.

844
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:17,239
She sometimes even cries.

845
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,508
Why would someone keep
Mommy's heart

846
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,911
if they don't love her anymore.

847
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,746
It's complicated, Dolly.

848
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,182
Sometimes grown ups
do silly things

849
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:27,516
that don't make any sense.

850
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:30,719
You'd give back the
bear, wouldn't you?

851
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:31,787
I would.

852
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:34,557
I only want mommy
to have a husband

853
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,192
so I can just have a daddy.

854
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:37,560
That's all.

855
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:39,195
Don't worry, Dolly.

856
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:40,429
It'll happen someday.

857
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,430
Really?

858
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,431
Yeah.

859
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,667
Yes. You deserve a good daddy.

860
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:47,736
Thank you Norman, I love you.

861
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:12,354
Hey! Wait! No! Stop!

862
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,890
Grandpa stop!

863
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,325
He was running!

864
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:17,359
Dori, listen to me.

865
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,394
I get this.

866
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:19,862
I get where this is going.

867
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:21,530
Stop! Stop!

868
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:30,806
It's all beginning
to make sense, okay.

869
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:34,510
You've had a rough
go of it with men.

870
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:36,612
What did Dolly tell you?

871
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:39,982
Nothing, really.

872
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:43,719
I mean nothing
I didn't already know.

873
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,754
I saw the boxes, Dori.

874
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:47,990
You're just thinking
about Albert and Dolly.

875
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:49,925
I get that.

876
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,694
You're just trying to do
what's right for them.

877
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:53,929
And guys like me? Guys like us?

878
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:56,966
You know, we...

879
00:53:56,968 --> 00:53:58,934
We've never made
it easy for you.

880
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:01,537
We're never thinking
with our right heads.

881
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:03,872
We're selfish, and we
forget there's emotions

882
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,608
wrapped up in this stuff.

883
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,777
And we don't realize that
we can hurt people's feelings,

884
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:11,480
and believe me...
If I've hurt you,

885
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:13,582
I'm really sorry.

886
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:16,485
Really?

887
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:17,553
Yes.

888
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:19,655
I'm really, really sorry.

889
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,360
He's full of it.

890
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:26,462
No, I'm not.

891
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,469
I'm giving it back, Dori.

892
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,372
I'm not like those other guys.

893
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:39,975
I'm giving it back.

894
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:43,979
I'm giving back
your heart, Dori.

895
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:47,116
So let's end this
thing right now.

896
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:49,952
Let's put it behind
us and move on.

897
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:52,655
What do you think?

898
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:55,724
Enough is enough.

899
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,670
Don't! It's not
what you think, Dori.

900
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:10,873
Who the hell is Cara?

901
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,875
You son-of-a-bitch!

902
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:14,877
After all
I've done for you! How!

903
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:18,747
How dare you do this
to my and my family!

904
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:20,849
You son-of-a-bitch!

905
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,621
You asshole!

906
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,924
So?

907
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:04,093
Who would like to begin?

908
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,632
I'll go.

909
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:11,734
Do you love her?

910
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,506
Who?

911
00:56:17,508 --> 00:56:20,676
Cara? Do you love her?

912
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:22,044
No.

913
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,513
Oh, so you're just
screwing her, is that it?

914
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:26,615
Maybe I'll just call Scotty
Griffin from the General Store

915
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:27,983
and start screwing him.

916
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:31,887
How would that make you feel?

917
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,156
Oh, I like Scotty Griffin.

918
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:38,260
He always has a warm
smile on his face.

919
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,233
We're not even together.

920
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:46,235
Yeah, you made that very clear.

921
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:49,238
You're just screwing her.

922
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,507
I mean you and me, Dori.

923
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:53,909
I'm not with you!
I'm not with Cara!

924
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:56,912
I'm not with anyone!

925
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,982
How can you say that
we're not together?

926
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:05,854
We. Are. Not. To-gether.

927
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,692
After everything
that I've done for you.

928
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:12,194
You're such an asshole.

929
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:15,030
That's not getting
us anywhere -

930
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:17,132
Fuck you too, Grandma.

931
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:21,136
I've done everything
you've asked me to.

932
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:23,605
I've put up with all
of your crazy shit.

933
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,776
Norman, is this because
you're afraid of commitment?

934
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,145
It's because she's
fucking kidnapped me.

935
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:32,047
It's because she's beaten
the shit out of me

936
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:33,515
and shackled me to the floor.

937
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:34,650
It's because she's ripped
the steering wheel

938
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:36,518
out of my fucking car!

939
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,054
Does Dr. Fisher have
a chapter on that one?

940
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:41,023
You do nothing
but finger point.

941
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:43,725
When are you going to start
owning up to your mistakes?

942
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:47,196
- You cheated on me, Goddamn you!
- For the love of God, woman!

943
00:57:47,198 --> 00:57:49,198
You're putting up walls
and retreating into yourself.

944
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,300
I'm retreating because you
scare the shit out of me!

945
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:13,655
Do you remember when I took
you to see Taming of the Shrew?

946
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,997
It was our third date?

947
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:25,334
Oh! Was that you?

948
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:26,235
You were walking back

949
00:58:26,237 --> 00:58:29,137
from getting us
drinks our eyes locked

950
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,206
and you had
a look on your face.

951
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,075
What was it?
What was that look?

952
00:58:33,077 --> 00:58:34,610
I don't know, Dori.

953
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:35,644
I love you?

954
00:58:35,646 --> 00:58:36,812
You love me?

955
00:58:36,814 --> 00:58:38,780
Your tits looked good
in your dress?

956
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,883
Any of those right?

957
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:48,023
Was there ever a chance
for you to love me?

958
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:56,999
I don't even know
what that word means.

959
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:58,267
That is such a shame,

960
00:58:58,269 --> 00:59:01,169
because you have no idea
what you're missing.

961
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,229
Can I just say something?

962
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,331
Of course, Norman.

963
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:37,873
You know... What you said,
that last thing.

964
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,241
What?

965
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:45,213
Uh, I mean...

966
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,916
Maybe I am missing something.

967
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,152
I mean it's not like
I have everything figured out.

968
00:59:50,154 --> 00:59:52,354
Take these holidays.

969
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:57,859
I haven't really been embracing
them to be perfectly honest.

970
00:59:57,861 --> 00:59:59,962
What are you getting at?

971
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:06,668
I don't know! Hey!

972
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:10,038
Why don't I take charge
of one of the holidays?

973
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,840
So now you want
to do a holiday?

974
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:14,710
Yeah! Hey, why don't we
celebrate Mother's Day?

975
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:17,679
Yeah, right. It's a little
too late to be sucking up.

976
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:19,781
I'm not sucking up.

977
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,786
What would Dr. Fisher say?

978
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:29,091
Well, that's a good question.

979
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:31,960
Dr. Fisher always says you
need to forgive your partner.

980
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,930
Forgive Dori,

981
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:36,832
this relationship has no hope

982
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:39,935
unless you forgive Norman

983
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:44,106
and give him another chance.

984
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:45,307
Yeah. Come on, Dori.

985
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,308
Let me rally the troops.

986
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,378
Make you breakfast,
bring it to you in bed.

987
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,179
I'm not saying I have
everything figured it out,

988
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:53,248
but I'm saying
I'm willing to try.

989
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,751
These holidays mean
nothing to you, Norman.

990
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:57,252
I know. But they
mean something to you.

991
01:00:57,254 --> 01:01:00,288
And that means something to me.

992
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:04,026
Please, Dori. Let me show
you what I'm capable of.

993
01:01:04,028 --> 01:01:06,061
It'll be nice.

994
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:24,846
Come on, let's pick up the pace.
Your mother's going to love it.

995
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,381
Aren't these flowers beautiful.

996
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:28,116
This isn't really
a Denver omelet

997
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:29,851
because the ham
isn't from Denver.

998
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,420
Yeah, we covered that already.

999
01:01:31,422 --> 01:01:33,755
All right.

1000
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:35,891
Let's go. Get in.

1001
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:36,892
Ready Mommy?

1002
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:37,959
Happy Mother's Day.

1003
01:01:37,961 --> 01:01:39,394
I picked the flowers.

1004
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:41,029
I stirred the eggs.

1005
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,030
Beautiful!

1006
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,231
Happy Mother's Day!

1007
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:44,232
Well?

1008
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,867
Well I'm not going to lie.

1009
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,269
It's pretty spectacular.

1010
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:49,438
And to think you doubted me.

1011
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,039
I don't know what to say.

1012
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,521
Dori - you don't
have to say anything!

1013
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:56,912
Oh you son-of-a-bitch!

1014
01:01:56,914 --> 01:01:58,413
You bastard!

1015
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:00,982
Norman! Norman! Fuck!

1016
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,419
Norman! Come back here!

1017
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:08,390
Norman! Norman!

1018
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:10,158
You come back here right now!

1019
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,127
You come back here right now!

1020
01:02:12,129 --> 01:02:14,129
Norman! Norman! Come back here!

1021
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:16,064
Norman! Norman! God damn you!

1022
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,866
Get back here! Norman!

1023
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:35,317
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck you, Norman!

1024
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,099
Norman! Norman, please!

1025
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,567
Dolly's having an attack!

1026
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:54,336
She can't breathe!

1027
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:56,438
She needs her inhaler!

1028
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,040
Please Norman!

1029
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:02,444
Please Norman!

1030
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,546
Fuck you, Dori.

1031
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:06,581
Please. I'm begging you!

1032
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:09,618
Norman, she's gonna die if
she doesn't get her inhaler.

1033
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:13,588
Please! Please! Please!

1034
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:17,125
I'm begging you! Please!

1035
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:21,329
Please! She's gonna die!

1036
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:23,398
I'm begging you!

1037
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,500
Dolly's going to die?

1038
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,960
Norman please hurry!

1039
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:53,895
I am! I am!

1040
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:55,030
Where is it?

1041
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:57,132
It's in the drawer
below the breadbox.

1042
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,675
Okay, I got it!

1043
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:12,047
Hurry up, Norman!

1044
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:13,615
What are you doing?
Dolly needs you!

1045
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:15,417
Don't fuck with me!

1046
01:04:15,419 --> 01:04:17,018
She needs you! Just hurry up!

1047
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,620
I promise I won't do anything.

1048
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:20,555
Okay. I'm just doing
this for Dolly.

1049
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:21,556
Hurry up!

1050
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:22,958
Don't you fuck with me!

1051
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,659
I got the inhaler!

1052
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:27,128
Unlock the door, please!
Just unlock the door!

1053
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:30,632
Please, just open the door,
toss the inhaler in

1054
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:33,101
I do that then you'll
hit me in the head

1055
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,536
with a microwave
or something. No way!

1056
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:36,371
Just open the door!

1057
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,505
Get in the closet!

1058
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:38,640
Norman!

1059
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:41,276
I'm not coming in until
everyone gets in the closet!

1060
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:43,378
Trick or treat.

1061
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:41,369
Can we open up
one present? Please?

1062
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:43,271
Not now. Maybe later.

1063
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,373
This is important.

1064
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:52,580
As you may have noticed,

1065
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:54,516
Daddy and I have
been having some

1066
01:05:54,518 --> 01:05:56,318
relationship hiccups.

1067
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,388
And I'm certainly not
here to place blame, okay?

1068
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:03,291
Although I'm not
the one who cheated.

1069
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:07,062
But as always, I'm going
to put our relationship

1070
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:09,798
in the hands of
my beloved family.

1071
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,767
So I want you all to
give this very careful?

1072
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:13,802
Stop touching me!

1073
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:18,139
I'm gonna have to put you
to bed right now, am I?

1074
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,375
No?

1075
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:22,210
We'll do our usual scoring.

1076
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:24,412
One out of ten, ten being best.

1077
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:26,081
Since there's five
of us, it'll be?

1078
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:28,550
What about me?
Don't I get a vote?

1079
01:06:28,552 --> 01:06:32,053
Let's say if he gets a total
of forty points, he'll stay.

1080
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:34,823
Anything less and, well...

1081
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:36,358
Be sure to cover
the Nativity scene.

1082
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,759
It has sentimental value.

1083
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:39,861
I remember. I remember.

1084
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:44,632
Hold on a second?

1085
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:46,801
What's that for?

1086
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:49,404
Don't you think forty is uh-

1087
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:51,406
Forty out of fifty
is a tad high?

1088
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:54,209
She deserves a
fifty out of fifty.

1089
01:06:57,114 --> 01:07:01,483
And it upsets me that you
think I should have to settle.

1090
01:07:01,485 --> 01:07:04,519
Come on, Dori. It's not settling
that much - thirty-five?

1091
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,088
It's still above average.

1092
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,858
So you're okay with
being just average?

1093
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,395
Above average.

1094
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:14,662
Wow. Okay then.

1095
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:18,666
Let's all vote on this slightly
above average relationship.

1096
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:20,602
All we need is
seven points per person

1097
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:25,807
and we can keep this slightly
above average family together.

1098
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:27,742
It's 10pm.

1099
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:30,311
Do you know where
your children are?

1100
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:31,679
Ooo, we gotta get
the kids to bed.

1101
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:34,315
It's getting late.

1102
01:07:34,317 --> 01:07:36,618
Okay. We need to get started.

1103
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,486
Thirty-five points it is.

1104
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:40,488
Who's first?

1105
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:41,556
Four!

1106
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:44,325
Grandpa starts
things off with a four.

1107
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:45,326
Who's next?

1108
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:46,327
A four?

1109
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:49,431
Only reason why you're even
getting that many is

1110
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:51,766
because I've seen Dori smilin'
around you a couple of times.

1111
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:54,569
Ed's never even taken the
time to get to know me.

1112
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:57,205
What I know, I don't like.

1113
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:59,307
A four.

1114
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:02,877
Moving on.

1115
01:08:02,879 --> 01:08:04,779
Okay. My turn. My turn.

1116
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:06,915
Albert, buddy. Whazzup?

1117
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:09,384
You know, when you first
got here, I was like,

1118
01:08:09,386 --> 01:08:11,219
"Wow! Finally mom
brought home a ten."

1119
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:12,620
A ten! Yes!
Hi five, little buddy!

1120
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:13,855
But...

1121
01:08:13,857 --> 01:08:17,759
then you opened
your potty mouth.

1122
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,861
Potty mouth?

1123
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:26,367
Mom?

1124
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:28,937
Just this once.

1125
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:30,238
'Fuck' six times,

1126
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,873
'Mother fucker' four times.

1127
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,708
'Cocksucker' five times,

1128
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,377
'Cocksucker mother fucker'
eight times.

1129
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:37,912
'Son of a bitch' three times,

1130
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:40,482
'Shit'...

1131
01:08:40,484 --> 01:08:41,583
Eleven times...

1132
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:45,186
And you told mom
to 'blow me' once.

1133
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:48,389
I'm not sure what that means
but I can tell it's bad.

1134
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:50,859
Oh, and I'm not
including the word "poo"

1135
01:08:50,861 --> 01:08:52,727
because Dolly and I
are allowed to say it.

1136
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:55,830
Ha-ha! He said poo!

1137
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:59,634
Alright fine, minus one point
for having a potty mouth.

1138
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,236
That's a nine.

1139
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:03,972
And speaking of potty,
I don't want a dad

1140
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,907
who still wets the bed.

1141
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:07,375
Okay, now... That's not fair!

1142
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:09,477
So that's minus another point.

1143
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:14,916
That's a total of twelve
points. Who's next?

1144
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:18,386
And twelve of thirty-five
is what percent?

1145
01:09:18,388 --> 01:09:19,621
What?

1146
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:21,222
You said you were
good at percentages.

1147
01:09:21,224 --> 01:09:24,025
Twelve of thirty-five
is what percent?

1148
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,731
Do you or don't you
know the answer?

1149
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:31,933
Give me a quick second.
I have to...

1150
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:33,535
I'll take that as a no.

1151
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:35,470
I give him a seven out of ten.

1152
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:37,405
That's seventy percent! Ha!

1153
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,440
And like Dolly couldn't
have gotten that one right.

1154
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:40,642
Nice try.

1155
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:42,911
Oh lookie here.

1156
01:09:42,913 --> 01:09:44,646
A rifle.

1157
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:47,682
What I've always wanted.

1158
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:50,018
Wait-wait-wait!

1159
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,820
Don't I get a chance
for rebuttal or something?

1160
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,959
Grandma, you're next.

1161
01:09:57,961 --> 01:09:59,761
On a commercial break.

1162
01:09:59,763 --> 01:10:01,996
Come on!
We gotta get this going.

1163
01:10:01,998 --> 01:10:03,331
Commercial break.

1164
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:04,766
Hit the Pause!

1165
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:05,900
I'll give him a ten.

1166
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:08,836
Yes! A ten! Loving you, Edna.

1167
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:10,939
Great, Grandma gives him a ten.

1168
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:13,474
You've got twenty one points.

1169
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:15,310
Dolly you're up.

1170
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:18,580
Out of ten points, how
much do you like Norman?

1171
01:10:18,582 --> 01:10:20,682
Of all the daddy's that
mommy has brought home

1172
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:23,384
I like Norman the best.

1173
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:25,553
Wow? Even better than Hans?

1174
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,322
Excuse me.
The child was talking.

1175
01:10:27,324 --> 01:10:31,759
I'm going to give him
the best number ever.

1176
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:33,528
And I thank you, Dolly.

1177
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:34,829
I always knew you?

1178
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:37,932
And the best number
is five and a half.

1179
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:39,467
What?

1180
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,302
Five and a half because
that's how old I am.

1181
01:10:41,304 --> 01:10:42,604
Five and a half.

1182
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:45,006
Aww lookie here!

1183
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:47,375
I guess I was good this year.

1184
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:49,444
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

1185
01:10:49,446 --> 01:10:50,778
Dori still gets a vote?

1186
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,779
Fat chance!

1187
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:53,481
You only got twenty six points.

1188
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:56,050
Twenty six and a half.

1189
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:59,320
There's no way Dori's
gonna give you a nine.

1190
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:00,955
Right?

1191
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,025
Norman. Believe me
when I say this

1192
01:11:04,027 --> 01:11:07,762
that no one wanted
this relationship more than me.

1193
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:10,398
God, you made me so happy.

1194
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:12,734
Grandma?

1195
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,037
Kids. Gotta go to bed.

1196
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,605
- But I wanna watch.
- No.

1197
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,340
- That's not fair.
- No.

1198
01:11:19,342 --> 01:11:21,009
It's past bedtime.

1199
01:11:21,011 --> 01:11:22,777
Albert! Come on.

1200
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,879
I never get to watch.

1201
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:36,924
Norman...

1202
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:41,462
I have tried and tried
and tried with you.

1203
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,031
But if I pull away
from the fairy tale

1204
01:11:43,033 --> 01:11:46,067
I have to be
honest with myself.

1205
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,738
Dori, please don't do this.

1206
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,940
For the first time in
my life I'm wondering

1207
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:56,811
if true love is even possible.

1208
01:11:56,813 --> 01:12:00,982
Dori, please listen to me.

1209
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:03,685
There was something there.

1210
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:06,754
We had something, it was there.

1211
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:11,793
No there wasn't.

1212
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:15,063
I was foolish
to think otherwise.

1213
01:12:15,065 --> 01:12:17,098
You're out for one thing
and one thing only.

1214
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,900
Just like those other men.

1215
01:12:18,902 --> 01:12:20,735
I'm not like those other men.

1216
01:12:20,737 --> 01:12:23,905
You're just like
those other men.

1217
01:12:23,907 --> 01:12:26,641
No. I'm not.

1218
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:29,977
See... look. I'm not.

1219
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:31,813
I'm not like those other men.

1220
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,452
I'm giving it back, Dori.

1221
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:39,554
I'm giving back your heart.

1222
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,925
See?

1223
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:46,694
Take it. Take the bear, Dori.

1224
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:49,897
Please, take the bear Dori.

1225
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:53,634
Please Dori. Take the bear.

1226
01:12:53,636 --> 01:12:54,802
Please! God!

1227
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:56,904
Dori, take the bear?

1228
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:13,588
Stop it! Alright!
It's fucking over!

1229
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:14,589
I'm telling
you right now man...

1230
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:15,890
back the fuck up!

1231
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,492
You won't do anything!

1232
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:21,028
I'm not fucking around.
I will blow her head off!

1233
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,231
Give me the keys to the collar.

1234
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:24,999
Give me the fucking keys!!!

1235
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:29,570
You can dangle there and
rot in hell for all I care.

1236
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,122
Fuck! Fuck!

1237
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:49,724
God damn it,
you fucking people!

1238
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:56,497
You lied to me, Norman.

1239
01:13:56,499 --> 01:13:57,965
Are you fucking kidding me?

1240
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:59,867
You've been nothing but a lie.

1241
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:03,004
I never lied about
the way I felt.

1242
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:16,317
Happy fucking New Year, Dori.

1243
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,546
How does love happen?

1244
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,284
With all the random
people in the world,

1245
01:15:56,286 --> 01:15:58,986
how do two of them
meet, connect,

1246
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:01,155
and then fall in love?

1247
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:12,066
A couple might feel
passion, or lust,

1248
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:14,135
but it's not the same.

1249
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:24,211
True love is strength and
security and it's forever.

1250
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:02,149
I loved you, Norman.

1251
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:05,720
I truly loved you.

1252
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:31,045
As we go about the chaos
of our daily lives,

1253
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:33,447
we're left wondering how, when,

1254
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:37,118
or even if it will
ever happen to us.

1255
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:46,327
But it happens.

1256
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:59,440
At a completely random,
but perfectly precise moment,

1257
01:17:59,442 --> 01:18:02,510
two people connect
and fall in love.

1258
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,759
It doesn't happen very often.

1259
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:25,433
That's why you have
to keep looking.

1260
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:48,122
And the search for love can be
a very scary and lonely journey.

1261
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:58,499
Sad to say - some hearts
get broken along the way.

1262
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:12,346
But I still believe in love.

1263
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:18,986
I still believe
there's someone out there

1264
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:22,056
who will sweep me off my feet.

1265
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,297
I know there is.

1266
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,503
There's got to be.

1267
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:39,907
I just have to keep looking.

1268
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:49,650
Maybe I will call
Scotty Griffin.
