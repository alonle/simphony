1
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:17,833
The Wall street journal
is better than ever

2
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,197
Did you bring the milk ?

3
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:09,980
This concludes our service.

4
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:11,588
Go now in the peace

5
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,513
of the Lord.

6
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:13,923
So long, suckers!

7
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:14,700
Move it, move it,

8
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,106
move it!

9
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:16,148
Do you want to be second

10
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:17,240
out of the parking lot?

11
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:17,796
Do you?

12
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:19,643
Leave her!

13
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,636
We left her last week,

14
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,500
and she didn't make
it home for dinner!

15
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:26,063
You'll never catch me, Lord!

16
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:29,171
Oh, man, that church

17
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:31,101
service was so boring.

18
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:32,301
I did a whole book

19
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:33,473
of Find-A-Words.

20
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,520
Dad, all you circled

21
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:37,232
were the "I"s and "A"s.

22
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:38,100
Those are words.

23
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:39,950
Well, where should
we go for brunch?

24
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:41,223
Griddler on the Roof?

25
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:43,442
Thank God
It's Fried Eggs?

26
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:44,813
Luftwaffle's?

27
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:46,373
Bodacious Frittatas?

28
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:47,982
Buffet the Hunger Slayer?

29
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:49,023
I want to say one.

30
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:50,280
Be my guest.

31
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:51,522
Denny's.

32
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,722
Every place has
such a long line.

33
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:55,441
Don't worry.

34
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:56,552
We'll just go home.

35
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:57,602
Your mother can cook.

36
00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:59,492
I just want a simple salad

37
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:00,583
with pine nuts,

38
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:01,560
haricots verts,

39
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:03,272
seasonal heirloom tomatoes...

40
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:04,201
Forget it!

41
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,720
One day a week, I should be able

42
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:06,941
to put on nice clothes and

43
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:08,910
have someone bring food to me.

44
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:09,960
There's a place...

45
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:11,061
with no line!

46
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:12,470
Woo-hoo!

47
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:16,402
Bart, that's not a restaurant,

48
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:17,713
it's somebody's house.

49
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:18,823
Lisa's right, son.

50
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:20,402
Your mom is way too classy

51
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:21,740
a lady to crash a private...

52
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:23,371
I'm not cooking!

53
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:26,622
And you can cut
your own meat!

54
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:33,030
Everyone just act cool.

55
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,042
If anyone asks, tell
them we're plumbers,

56
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,273
and then start plumbing
until they go away.

57
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,683
Hi...

58
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:39,800
you!

59
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:42,810
Dude! You don't think,
you know me, but you do!

60
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:48,630
Oh Homer, you've got to try
this roast beef au jus.

61
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:52,012
Mmm! Au jus!

62
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,263
Not quite gravy,

63
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,571
not quite blood.

64
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:56,313
Look at the crowd
around that table!

65
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:59,171
It must be a make-
your-own sundae bar!

66
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,272
Watch it.

67
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:01,241
Oh, I can't wait to

68
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:02,552
taste that hot fudge,

69
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:04,690
and caramel and crushed nuts

70
00:04:04,698 --> 00:04:07,023
all slathered over a delicious...

71
00:04:07,026 --> 00:04:08,393
elderly corpse?!

72
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:10,900
We crashed a funeral!

73
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:11,981
Oh, my God!

74
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:12,823
Quick, everyone,

75
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:14,500
put on their long faces.

76
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,051
Longer!

77
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:23,213
We should get out of here.

78
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:24,231
Come on!

79
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:27,502
Where's Bart?

80
00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:29,243
Mahogany.

81
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:29,943
Great movie,

82
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:30,751
great casket.

83
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,730
I miss my Pop-pop.

84
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:34,140
I miss him, too.

85
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:35,120
What's your name?

86
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:35,992
Donny.

87
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:37,331
You're Donny?

88
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,172
Pop-pop said that
after he died,

89
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:42,482
you should give me
ten bucks a week.

90
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:44,292
Starting now.

91
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:45,843
Okay.

92
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:47,343
Um, listen,

93
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:50,443
I'm out of town next week, so...

94
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:51,751
Come on, we're leaving!

95
00:04:51,768 --> 00:04:53,993
Ooh. After one more mini-quiche.

96
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,920
Excuse me.

97
00:04:57,927 --> 00:04:59,540
My brother twisted his ankle

98
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:00,892
setting up the chairs.

99
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:02,681
Will the tragedies that stalk

100
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:05,223
this family never cease?

101
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:09,210
Would you like to
be a pallbearer?

102
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:10,300
Of course.

103
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:14,581
I thought she said polar bear.

104
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:16,892
Please, sir, a little
respect for the dead.

105
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:17,940
Oh, yes, of course.

106
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:21,663
Oh, my back!

107
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:22,660
It hurts,

108
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,510
and not in a good way.

109
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:26,700
Well, time to move on with our lives.

110
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:30,542
Oh, stop it!

111
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:33,232
Help me !

112
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:34,501
I'm down here.

113
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,833
Homer, you have a mild back sprain.

114
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:39,222
And you also ingested

115
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:41,120
a dangerous quantity of grave dirt.

116
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:42,693
Well, you're always telling me

117
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:44,161
I should eat more dirt.

118
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:46,333
Not dirt. Vegetables!

119
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,591
Which grow in what?

120
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,782
Oh! Look, I just need to make sure

121
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,722
your vertebrae are properly aligned.

122
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,903
This should take only a minute,

123
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:56,303
and cost about a thousand dollars.

124
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,292
D'oh!

125
00:05:57,298 --> 00:05:58,562
That doesn't sound like Homer's

126
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,260
usual annoyed grunt.

127
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:02,370
D'oh!

128
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,400
D'oh.

129
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:04,480
Fascinating.

130
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:06,853
When Homer's on his back,

131
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:09,300
his stomach lodges perfectly
under his diaphragm,

132
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:11,211
giving him a powerful singing voice.

133
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:12,562
Is that a real thing?

134
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:13,443
It is!

135
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:14,831
Tenor Andrea Bocelli

136
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:17,283
recorded an entire song on his back.

137
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:18,052
You know, Homer,

138
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:20,170
your singing could help alleviate patient suffering,

139
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:21,912
and save us a fortune in Demerol.

140
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,342
My pleasure.

141
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:27,571
<i>If ever I would leave you</i>

142
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:31,600
<i>It wouldn't be in summer</i>

143
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,500
<i>Seeing you in summer</i>

144
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:39,126
<i>I never would go</i>

145
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:43,013
<i>Your hair streaked with sunlight</i>

146
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,776
<i>Your lips red as flame</i>

147
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:50,302
<i>Your face with a luster</i>

148
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:54,611
<i>That puts gold to shame!</i>

149
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:58,332
<i>But if I ever leave you</i>

150
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:00,901
<i>It shouldn't be in autumn</i>

151
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:03,111
<i>How I'd leave in autumn</i>

152
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:06,582
<i>I never will know</i>

153
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:10,600
<i>I've seen how you sparkle</i>

154
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:14,232
<i>When fall nips the air</i>

155
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:18,243
<i>I know you in autumn</i>

156
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:22,030
<i>And I must be there.</i>

157
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,833
Ah, nothing lifts my spirits like shopping.

158
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:28,123
Let's see, I'll take his liver,

159
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,681
a case of Adam's apples,

160
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:31,843
that motorcycle man's moustache.

161
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:33,710
Oh, the money you've
contributed to anti-helmet

162
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:35,362
laws has really paid off, sir.

163
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,690
Well, young people are my future.

164
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:39,423
<i>And could I leave you</i>

165
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:42,702
<i>Running merrily through the snow...</i>

166
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:43,930
That beautiful voice!

167
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:45,681
It's making my heart race!

168
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:52,250
- Knowing how in spring...
- It's coming from down the hall.

169
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:54,882
To the Betty and Herbert Weinstein Pavilion!

170
00:07:56,556 --> 00:08:00,652
<i>Oh, no! Not in springtime</i>

171
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:05,523
<i>Summer, winter or fall</i>

172
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:09,433
<i>No, never could I leave you...</i>

173
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:15,361
<i>At... all!</i>

174
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:18,231
Excellent, excellent!

175
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:19,583
The Springfield Opera House,

176
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:21,473
of which I am founder, artistic director,

177
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:22,722
and standing ovation starter,

178
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,240
is producing La Bohème.

179
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,363
I want you to sing the lead.

180
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:28,963
But I can only sing lying on my back.

181
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:31,280
Uh, we'll cover it with a rewrite.

182
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:39,580
Places, everyone!

183
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,430
Oh, oh, I just have one question:

184
00:08:41,446 --> 00:08:42,690
what is this movie about?

185
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:44,580
For the last time, it's not a movie!

186
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:46,643
Excuse me, "film."

187
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:48,030
It's an opera

188
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:49,550
and you are in it!

189
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:51,501
Good luck.

190
00:08:55,797 --> 00:09:00,093
<i>Rodolfo, perché lete che vi trovate gio?</i>

191
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:04,400
<i>Ho danneggiato il mio piede.</i>

192
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:08,040
<i>Nei cieli bigi</i>

193
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:13,123
<i>Guardo fumar dai mille comignoli parigi.</i>

194
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:15,131
- Homer's fantastic!
- Yeah.

195
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,160
But these seats are terrible.

196
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,592
Mimi! Mimi!

197
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:34,592
Mimi! Mimi!

198
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:39,812
Bravo! Bravo!

199
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:41,982
Bravo! Belisimo !

200
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:44,161
Encore! Encore!

201
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,831
My boy, you are a star.

202
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,542
Woo-hoo!

203
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:50,413
An opera star!

204
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:55,060
Dad, you were great!

205
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,360
And you contributed to our culture!

206
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:58,653
Well, I didn't mean to.

207
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:00,300
No, no. It's a good thing.

208
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:01,380
Oh, good.

209
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:03,501
This makes up for me showing up drunk

210
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:05,351
to the father-daughter dance.

211
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:07,131
The dance isn't till next week.

212
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:07,990
Sorry, Lisa.

213
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:09,401
Can't change the future.

214
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:32,980
And the home

215
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:35,750
Of the...

216
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:39,901
Bra-aave !

217
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,922
We're free !

218
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:52,201
Figaro, Figaro, la, la, la

219
00:10:52,998 --> 00:10:55,972
Nice set, Homer.
That was a hot one.

220
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:59,843
Wow, praise
from Placido Domingo.

221
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:01,800
Just call me P-Dingo.

222
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,391
Eh, I'll think about it.

223
00:11:04,606 --> 00:11:05,451
You know, Homer,

224
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,880
there's one thing about opera
that has always bugged me:

225
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:11,363
everyone sings instead of talking.

226
00:11:11,848 --> 00:11:13,862
But you mademe believe

227
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:18,063
I was in a magical world
where singing is talking.

228
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:19,103
Thanks !

229
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:22,313
You know, of the three tenors,
you're my second favorite !

230
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,443
No wait, I forgot about
that other guy.

231
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:25,711
Sorry, you're third.

232
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:28,822
Wait, Homer, before you go,

233
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:31,623
there is a new note
I've been working on.

234
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:33,001
Tell me what you think...

235
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:45,891
what if you gave it a little
more of this flavor...

236
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:51,030
Like this ?

237
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:56,002
Keep reaching for the stars, kid.

238
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,000
Happy anniversary, sweetie.

239
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:05,351
You know, it might be
a little more romantic

240
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,292
without your entourage.

241
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,150
But I need my childhood friends
to help me keep it real.

242
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:11,763
Would you have me keep it fake ?

243
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:14,110
Homer, can't weplease be alone ?

244
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:15,981
It's our anniversary.

245
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:18,570
We'll move to another table.

246
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:20,550
Yoko.

247
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:21,790
See ?

248
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:24,483
Isn't it nicer,
with just you and...

249
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:25,431
Excuse us.

250
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:28,562
Would you mind signing
autographs for my mother and me ?

251
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:30,432
Oh, my pleasure.

252
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:34,080
To the hottest girls in the room.

253
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:36,073
What is he saying ?

254
00:12:36,245 --> 00:12:37,851
I said you look hot !

255
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:40,352
Ay Chihuahua !

256
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:43,160
- Ay chi-what ?
- Hua-hua !

257
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:45,823
I want you to stop
flirting with women.

258
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:46,903
No problem.

259
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:50,641
Sir, may I say I thoroughly
enjoyed your performance.

260
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:51,940
May I say

261
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:55,650
I'm enjoying the calm waters
of your deep, blue eyes ?

262
00:12:55,977 --> 00:12:57,323
Oh, well...

263
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:00,312
What ?

264
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:01,552
That's how guys talk.

265
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:04,933
You are out of control !

266
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:06,843
The late nights, the eating !

267
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:09,193
You've actually
outgrown your cape !

268
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:14,202
Oh, Homie...
I miss our alone time.

269
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,212
I miss you.

270
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:20,012
Need some help, H ?

271
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:21,893
Want us to take Marge shopping ?

272
00:13:22,156 --> 00:13:24,891
You guys go on,
we're gonna walk home.

273
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,081
Great call, H,
walking's the best.

274
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:30,941
I really want to
hook up with Homer.

275
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,333
Now we both know
that ain't gonna happen,

276
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:35,601
but, uh, I'm right here.

277
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:48,943
Marge, when I'm on stage,

278
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:53,010
I can only sing those love songs
by picturing your beautiful face.

279
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:57,882
So in a way, my groupies
are really our groupies.

280
00:13:58,307 --> 00:13:59,683
Aw, you're sweet.

281
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:01,451
Oh, my God, it's him !

282
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:12,541
Use your opera glasses, Dorothy.

283
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:18,513
Switching to thermal imaging.

284
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,640
Target acquired.

285
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:30,753
Oh, we're trapped.

286
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:33,052
Your fans will rip us to pieces.

287
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:34,231
Not me, they love me.

288
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:45,971
Get on.

289
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:55,823
Sir, thank youfor saving us.

290
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:57,502
Do you want
to come in for coffee ?

291
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:01,183
That's right, I'm a woman.

292
00:15:01,488 --> 00:15:03,422
A lady motorcycle driver ?!

293
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,173
What is this, The Twilight Zone ?

294
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:11,003
It's a shame a few out of control fans
can make the rest of us look bad.

295
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:13,471
I couldn't agree more, Julia.

296
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,302
Listen, I love opera,

297
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,550
but I hate the way these people
treat your husband.

298
00:15:17,638 --> 00:15:19,733
Why don't you make me president
of Homer's fan club

299
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,551
and I'll keep the
crazies in check.

300
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:23,912
That's a great idea.

301
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:27,103
To celebrate, I'll go whip us up
some Chex Mix pie.

302
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:29,333
So did you see the show tonight ?

303
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:31,363
Remember the part
where I forgot the words

304
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:33,782
and I just sang
"Uh-oh Spaghetti-os" ?

305
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,412
I'm hoping they send me a case.

306
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:40,381
Now listen, Homer.

307
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:42,512
You can have meany
time you want me.

308
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,060
Marge !

309
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:45,672
But if you say
one word to your wife,

310
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:46,870
I'll tell her you attacked me.

311
00:15:47,106 --> 00:15:48,360
What is it, sweetie ?

312
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:52,411
Um... everyone's
wearing clothes in here.

313
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:53,602
That's nice.

314
00:15:55,017 --> 00:15:58,501
Mr. Simpson will send you a photo if
you send him a self-addressed envelope.

315
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:01,833
Mr. Simpson can not sing
at your daughter's birthday,

316
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:03,303
but he will come for cake.

317
00:16:04,158 --> 00:16:06,562
Dedicate your shopping center ?
What's the anchor store ?

318
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:08,010
I don't think so.

319
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:09,483
She's perfect !

320
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:13,860
For the first time since you became
an opera star I can finally relax.

321
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:16,633
Well, uh, I'm not sure
she's working out.

322
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:42,412
That's it !

323
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:43,970
Let me make
something very clear:

324
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:46,870
my heart belongs to Marge
and you can never, ever have it.

325
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:50,220
This opera's over
when the fat man sings.

326
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:53,792
All right, Homer.
I understand perfectly.

327
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,160
You shall never be mine.

328
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,403
That's good.
You've calmly accepted

329
00:16:57,535 --> 00:17:00,093
that you will never have the
only man you could ever love.

330
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,143
Now, I think it would
be best if you left.

331
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:06,211
- Julia, wait !
- Yes ?

332
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:07,442
Before you go,

333
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:09,460
could you hire your
own replacement ?

334
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:12,590
But make sure she's
not crazy like you.

335
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:21,161
Die, you stupid cobra !

336
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:22,473
Die ! Die !

337
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,620
Dad, I think someone's
trying to kill you.

338
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:28,662
Who could it be ?

339
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,260
A disgruntled former employee ?

340
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:33,481
Whoever it is, the cobra
is their symbol.

341
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:40,270
D'oh, d'oh, d'oh,
d'oh, d'oh, d'oh, d'oh

342
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:44,120
Woo, woo, woo,
woo, woo, woo-hoo

343
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:49,250
Stu, stu, stu,stu-pid Flanders.

344
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:51,373
Why the crescendo,
my dear, old friend-o ?

345
00:17:51,726 --> 00:17:54,162
Get lost you waste
of a moustache.

346
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:55,441
Okily-dokily.

347
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:59,472
Chief, I think we should
cancel the performance.

348
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,580
No can do, Marge.

349
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,752
My first duty is to the
season-ticket holders.

350
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:06,413
But don't worry, I've got the entire
opera house on a complete lockdown.

351
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:08,611
I got sharp shooters on the gares,

352
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:11,082
inflatable Homer decoys in the seats,

353
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,322
and to take out
the biggest threat of all,

354
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:15,343
we're pre-crashing
the chandelier.

355
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:27,862
<i>Se il mio nome saper voi bramate</i>

356
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:31,742
<i>Dal mio labbro il mio nome...</i>

357
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:34,162
I'm so tense.

358
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:36,702
I can't enjoy Count Almaviva serenading

359
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,030
the intended bride of Dr. Bartalo.

360
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:40,280
I just can't.

361
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:42,002
I don't see anything suspicious.

362
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:45,782
Except someone is loudlyun
wrapping their candy.

363
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:48,612
It ain't candy, it's a lamb chop
wrapped in foil.

364
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:51,770
Hey, Mom, do all
conductors carry

365
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:53,421
poisoned blow-darts
in their pocket ?

366
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:56,791
Well, Arthur Fiedler used to,
but I'd better take a look.

367
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:03,263
Chief Wiggums !

368
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:05,503
The maestro is the killer !

369
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,482
All right, I'm going in.

370
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,190
Allegro ! Allegro !

371
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,983
I mean, andante. Andante !

372
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:19,702
Ah, yeah.

373
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:31,391
Snipers, take the shot.

374
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:51,142
Okay, that's a wrap, people !

375
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:55,071
Luckily, the sniper bullets

376
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:56,892
stopped her heart
from pumping the poison

377
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:59,292
through her body long enough
for the chandelier

378
00:19:59,486 --> 00:20:00,512
to squish it all out of her.

379
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:03,003
With any luck, she'll be up
and stalking within a week.

380
00:20:05,398 --> 00:20:06,780
I'm sorry you got hurt,

381
00:20:06,977 --> 00:20:08,770
but you learned
an important lesson.

382
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,433
No one comes between
me and my Homie.

383
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,311
I'll get you for this, Marge,

384
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:15,750
if it's the last thing I do.

385
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:19,033
And I scheduled the cable guy to come
on Wednesday between 10:00 and 2:00.

386
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:21,300
Oh, but Wednesday's
not good for me.

387
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:23,360
I know, Marge. I know.

388
00:20:29,356 --> 00:20:31,361
Let's go, Hagliacci,

389
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:34,393
or should I say,
Madame Butterface ?

390
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:36,310
What ? What ?
I had two.

391
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,110
Well, that's it.

392
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,440
I'm retiring from the opera.

393
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,121
It's just too popular.

394
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:46,682
And I know something much more
fun I can do on my back.

395

396
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:52,811
Singing opera made me
good at painting.

397
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,352
- Is that a real thing ?
- No.
