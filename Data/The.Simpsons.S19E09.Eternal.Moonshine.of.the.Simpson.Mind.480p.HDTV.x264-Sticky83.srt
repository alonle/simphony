00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:23,149
Yeah, how ya doin'?

4
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:37,229
H-Hey, what?

5
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:40,332
Oh! Oh, cleats!

6
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:42,368
Homie, what happened?

7
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:45,905
Uh... maybe
some easy-listening music

8
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:48,240
will make you feel better
about the story.

9
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:49,675
Turn on 89.9.

10
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:55,714
Like most of my problems,
it all started at Moe's...

11
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:57,883
All right, so the rules are

12
00:00:57,918 --> 00:00:59,885
every time the news
guy says "senator,"

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,687
we got to take a drink.

14
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:03,355
Huh. It'll be nice
to let someone else decide

15
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,324
when I drink--
too much pressure.

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,194
Uh, yeah, Channel Six tip line?

17
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:10,863
I just caught two senators
doin' it in the alley.

18
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:12,865
And me?
I'm just a reliable source.

19
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,967
Not "sauce," "source."

20
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:17,736
Source! S-A-U-R-C-E!

21
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:20,739
We have heard
from a very reliable sauce

22
00:01:20,774 --> 00:01:23,375
news involving
multiple senators.

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,110
I'm going to read a list
of senators,

24
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:27,079
with possibly more senators
to be named later

25
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:29,949
by other senators:
Senator Abercrombie,

26
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:33,052
Senator Billingsley,
Senator Beaumont...

27
00:01:35,622 --> 00:01:38,624
Hmm? Oh, damn,
the plaster's flaking again.

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,527
<i>Once intoxicated,</i>
<i>we had a great idea.</i>

29
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:43,696
Hey! Swings!

30
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:47,199
I'm a kid again!

31
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,536
Oh... gah...

32
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,704
I'll save you!

33
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:57,910
Oh, the only way out is in!

34
00:01:57,944 --> 00:01:59,111
Hey, look at me!

35
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:01,647
I'm going <i>up</i> a slide!

36
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:03,816
Homer! Homer!

37
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,484
Best recess ever!

38
00:02:07,187 --> 00:02:08,087
Whoa.

39
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:09,421
Help me, guys! Guys?

40
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:12,591
Don't worry, Homer,
I'll call the cops!

41
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:14,126
I'll write
my senator.

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,161
Senator!
Senator!

43
00:02:17,197 --> 00:02:19,098
Oh, am I gonna die
on a playground,

44
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:22,635
like some uncoordinated child?

45
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:25,037
But I did learn something
from all this:

46
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:29,074
the sprinklers in this park
come on at 3:00 a.m.

47
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,111
Hey, thanks for
throwing the ball back.

48
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:33,312
Really.

49
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:36,782
I'll come back
with the fire truck.

50
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:39,685
I just have to get the kids
to school first.

51
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,120
Oh, are the kids with you?

52
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:42,288
- Hi, Dad.
- Homer.

53
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:44,557
Hey, guys! Why are you
ducked-down like that?

54
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:46,692
Don't want to be seen with
you when you're hitting bottom.

55
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:48,327
At least
we hope it's bottom.

56
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:51,130
Don't worry,
it's bottom, all right.

57
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:56,835
<i>And that's why</i>

58
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,337
I was tardy today.

59
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:00,339
And with that tardiness,
you have at last crossed

60
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:03,142
the boundary where I can legally
apply physical discipline.

61
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:04,810
Willie,
cut me a switch!

62
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:07,479
What about the one
your ma used on you?

63
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:09,481
It, uh, broke on my buttocks.

64
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:13,319
Serves you right for eating jam
straight out of the jar.

65
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:17,156
Damn it! That's not
even a swivel chair.

66
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:21,360
Skate, skate
as fast as you can.

67
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:23,896
But I'll catch you--
I'm the Principal Man!

68
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,965
That's the kind of education
you're missing.

69
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:32,104
Oh, no. Uphill.

70
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:33,839
The one place my car can't go.

71
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:41,013
Uh, would you like a quote?

72
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:42,348
Uh, yes.

73
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:44,350
"Some cause happiness
wherever they go;

74
00:03:44,384 --> 00:03:47,086
others whenever they go."
Oscar Wilde.

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,955
Uh, P.S.
Your car is totaled.

76
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,659
Whew! Safe.

77
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,161
Oh, not totally.

78
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:57,296
Whoa!

79
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,998
What-what are you doing in here?

80
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,566
Hiding from the cops.

81
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,635
Well, I can't have cops
sniffing around here.

82
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:04,303
Some of them might be girls.

83
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:05,804
Can't I just stay a little?

84
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:09,041
I only committed this robbery
to help my kid.

85
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:10,542
See, this is Jeremy.

86
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:11,877
I need to get him braces.

87
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:13,879
I always thought
that if I'd had braces,

88
00:04:13,913 --> 00:04:16,015
I'd have smiled more.

89
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,017
Hey, I bet
you have a great smile.

90
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,018
Huh?

91
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,285
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

92
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,287
Bart, Bart, we're in
whatchamacallit...

93
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:23,756
a pursuit!

94
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,790
So why'd you come here?

95
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:26,759
I run a respectable tree house.

96
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:28,160
Just wondering
if you've seen anything.

97
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:31,230
Uh, word is you'll, uh...
you'll snitch for candy.

98
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:33,932
You can't buy me with
a candy bar that has coconut.

99
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:36,769
Then maybe this is more your...
neighborhood.

100
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:37,770
Nice real estate.

101
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:39,238
You got a deal.

102
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:40,506
So, what do you know?

103
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,710
I saw a guy with a gun
and a snake tattoo...

104
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:47,880
say he was gonna hide out
on top of Mount Springfield.

105
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:49,815
Mount Springfield, eh?

106
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:52,317
Strap on your crampons, boys!

107
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:54,820
Eddie! Prepare my litter!

108
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,155
Lou, you are responsible

109
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:58,957
for my oxygen, food, water
and cleaning!

110
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:00,926
You have to clean me.
I clean you. Yeah.

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,927
Dude, thank you.

112
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,429
Why did you save me?

113
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:05,330
We outlaws have
to stick together.

114
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:07,032
Outlaw? You?

115
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,702
Stolen bowling shoes,
3-D glasses, Krusty standee

116
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:12,037
and this "cage" for my pet.

117
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:13,939
Oh. What do you feed him?

118
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:15,340
My A.D.D. meds.

119
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,744
Um, listen,

120
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:21,580
would you like two tickets
to the school musical?

121
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:24,249
My son plays the butcher.

122
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:25,951
In <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

123
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,786
I'm busy that night.

124
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,354
Yeah, lucky you.

125
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,193
Huh?

126
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:39,131
Are you okay?

127
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:41,066
Don't put more
in there!

128
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,601
Going for the record.

129
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,270
What record?
Stupidest death?

130
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:47,139
Aah!

131
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:50,542
Blagh!

132
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:52,377
<i>Merci beaucoup!</i>

133
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:53,645
Oh, well, you're very wel...

134
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,114
That's French
for "hello."

135
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:58,117
Actually, I think it...
Lucas Bortner, competitive eater.

136
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:59,785
A fat kid with a dream?

137
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,920
I can't compete with that.

138
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:04,523
What does
a competitive eater eat?

139
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:08,026
All the glamour foods: pizza,
boiled eggs, chicken wings

140
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:11,563
and the big enchilada, which
is not enchiladas but hot dogs.

141
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:13,365
69 hot dogs
is the current record.

142
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,000
As the great Kobayashi says,

143
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:17,402
<i>"Detekurutoki itaiyo."</i>

144
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:19,004
What does that mean?

145
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:20,472
"That's gonna hurt coming out."

146
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:23,142
Is Kobayashi
the number one, um, uh...

147
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:25,210
The correct term
is "gurgitator."

148
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:27,112
I won't be using
the correct term then.

149
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:29,782
Virtually everyone uses
his technique: Japanesing.

150
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:31,650
Shall I demonstrate?

151
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:34,820
Um, why don't I just go sit
alone... Oh, you're doing it.

152
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:36,822
Ready, set...

153
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,857
Japanese!

154
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:44,496
That's not going down.

155
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:46,965
This happens
from time to time.

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,535
Maybe this isn't
the sport for you.

157
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,003
It's not a sport.

158
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:52,538
It's my life.

159
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:54,473
<i>Aw, he's sweet.</i>

160
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:56,341
<i>What am I doing?</i>

161
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,410
<i>He's just Ralph with a dream.</i>

162
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:00,345
<i>The dream of not ralphing.</i>

163
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,715
<i>But I'm sure I could</i>
<i>totally change and fix him.</i>

164
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,518
Can I join you for lunch?
Um, sure.

165
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:08,353
How many whole pizzas
would you like?

166
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:10,722
Um, can I just have a slice?

167
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:12,825
Interesting technique.

168
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:16,261
Whoa.

169
00:07:16,296 --> 00:07:19,064
You didn't tell me you
had a PlayStadium 4!

170
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:21,867
It's the first
I've seen it.

171
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:24,403
Something's fishy, Bart.

172
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:26,338
Where's the gift receipt?

173
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:29,074
Where's the packet of desiccant
that says "Do not eat"?

174
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:31,677
And, believe me, you shouldn't.

175
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:35,214
I have a feeling this
PlayStadium was liberated

176
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:39,518
from its previous owner and
given to me in gratitude.

177
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:40,786
Liberated?

178
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,554
You mean "stolen"?

179
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:44,556
You can't spell "crime"
without "me."

180
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:46,558
C-R-I...

181
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:49,528
There it is,
at the end!

182
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:53,265
Oh, hi. Is-is Lisa home?

183
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:54,266
Yes, she is.

184
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,567
And who are you?

185
00:07:55,602 --> 00:07:57,569
Lucas.

186
00:07:57,604 --> 00:07:58,971
It's pronounced
"Luca-dollar."

187
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:00,305
That's my competition name.

188
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,840
I'm a competitive eater.

189
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,175
Competitive eater?

190
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,677
Did I hear right?
I could be a competitive eater?

191
00:08:05,712 --> 00:08:07,412
No! You didn't hear anything!

192
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,548
Yes, I did! I heard
"competitive eater"!

193
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:12,751
It's for people
who haven't had heart problems.

194
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,020
Then that makes me the
Jackie Robinson of the sport,

195
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:18,023
and you are the racist
Philadelphia manager.

196
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:21,026
Quit comparing me
to Ben Chapman.

197
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,495
I will when you open
your mind to change!

198
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:25,297
Oh...!

199
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:27,199
So, what should we practice:

200
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:28,800
um, Vienna sausage;

201
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:31,203
blueberry pie, short form;

202
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:33,205
oatmeal, long course;

203
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:36,575
freestyle baked beans;
catfish-- ooh!

204
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:37,576
Cow brains.

205
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,577
Beans, beans!

206
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:39,878
We'll do beans.

207
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:44,716
Hmm. Never saw the pork
eat the beans before.

208
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:51,790
Actually, I'm a little surprised
Lisa likes him.

209
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:53,091
Really!

210
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:54,326
Justin Blobber over there

211
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,395
doesn't remind
you of anyone?

212
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:59,564
$800 to cut me out
of that slide?!

213
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:02,401
It's all about the money
with those firemen.

214
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:05,137
Women marry
their fathers, Marge.

215
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:08,407
So you just might be meeting
your future "ton-in-law."

216
00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:11,977
Ton-in-law.

217
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,812
God bless us.

218
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,415
You can do better.

219
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:27,615
<i>My sisters are nuts.</i>

220
00:09:27,753 --> 00:09:29,854
<i>I'm happy being married</i>
<i>to Homer.</i>

221
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:32,490
<i>Most of the time.</i>

222
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:41,399
Ooh! What the...?

223
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:08,593
Meep, meep!

224
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:20,405
Hmm...

225
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:23,908
Maybe you're not cut out
for competitive eating.

226
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:25,910
Are you calling me not fat?

227
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:27,912
No, I'm just... I...

228
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:30,581
Maybe you just haven't
found the right food, huh?

229
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:32,183
How 'bout ice cream?

230
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:33,251
Yes!

231
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:35,620
I will lay some hurt
on that cream.

232
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:38,189
Oh, my God! Brain freeze!

233
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:39,957
Oh, my God.

234
00:10:39,992 --> 00:10:41,993
Kick me in the head
till I pass out.

235
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:45,530
Harder! I'm still conscious!

236
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:47,231
You must kick me harder.

237
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:56,007
Okay, honey, I made you pork
chops just like you like 'em.

238
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,842
Twenty.
Thanks, babe.

239
00:10:57,876 --> 00:11:01,212
Sorry you had to drop out of
college to feed me full-time.

240
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:02,780
Now give us a kiss.

241
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,990
What the...?

242
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,627
Oh, yawn.

243
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:17,728
Another freebie.

244
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:19,397
Better be a 64 gig.

245
00:11:20,532 --> 00:11:22,400
Huh? It's full of lame apps:

246
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:25,503
Bully Avoider,
Nosebook, Insta-Grandma.

247
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:28,005
This was stolen from Milhouse!

248
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,607
From my backpack.

249
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,843
Where Puppy Goo-Goo sleeps.

250
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:34,912
Maybe it's time to tell me
exactly what's going on.

251
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:36,247
Relax.

252
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:39,217
Listen to the music
of this bubble game.

253
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:45,389
So peaceful.

254
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:47,358
No! I won't let this go!

255
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:50,228
It's time you told me how you've
been getting all this stuff.

256
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:55,132
I helped Snake out of a jam so
he paid me back in stolen stuff.

257
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,134
It was an honorable arrangement.

258
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:59,237
But I never thought
he'd steal from you.

259
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:00,972
Snake, eh?

260
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:02,640
I never would've suspected

261
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:06,077
the one criminal in town.

262
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,847
You seem stressed.

263
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:11,122
You want to suck some Squishee?

264
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:12,817
Sure.

265
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:13,818
Mmm!

266
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:14,819
Careful.

267
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:16,053
It's uncut syrup.

268
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:17,722
They give it to horses
before they race.

269
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:26,998
Jailbird, A Snake.

270
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:28,099
That's his real name.

271
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,867
Albert Knickerbocker
Aloysius Snake--

272
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:32,169
has been arrested for a series
of thefts and may be

273
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:34,739
put to death under
a controversial new statute.

274
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:37,375
Yeah, we had
a law stating

275
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:39,176
"Three strikes
and you're out."

276
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:41,612
But I thought it
was "You're out."

277
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:43,014
So I let people go.

278
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:46,484
So now it's
"Four balls and you walk.

279
00:12:46,518 --> 00:12:48,786
Right to the
electric chair."

280
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,855
It's, uh, much
clearer, Kent.

281
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:52,823
Bart, I'm so sorry.

282
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:55,960
I just wanted to ruin
his life, not end it.

283
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:57,461
You ratted him out?

284
00:12:57,496 --> 00:12:59,263
He's got a kid.

285
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:00,431
A kid?!

286
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:02,800
I was crushed
when I lost my dad

287
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,536
and all he did was move
to the Holiday Inn.

288
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:07,271
I can still see him smoking

289
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:09,407
<i>on the balcony.</i>

290
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:11,542
<i>He looked like</i>
<i>he missed something.</i>

291
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,544
Maybe me.

292
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:16,180
So you see,
we can't let Jailbird fry.

293
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:18,983
Time for the
Sleepover Detectives.

294
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:20,518
I didn't say
there'd be a sleepover.

295
00:13:20,552 --> 00:13:23,788
Too bad, 'cause I'm wearing
my pajamas under my clothes.

296
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,856
And my swimsuit
under those.

297
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:28,492
One day it'll all pay off.

298
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:33,564
Oh! There's my magazine.

299
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,732
Why, look at this.

300
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:37,768
"What every father should do
for his daughter."

301
00:13:37,803 --> 00:13:40,938
Oh, Marge, if you want me
to do something, just tell me.

302
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:42,373
Don't hide behind a magazine.

303
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:45,710
Right. Right, right, right.
According to Judy Kleinsmith,

304
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:47,812
a professional freelance writer,

305
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:50,214
fathers should take
their daughters out on little

306
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:53,651
dinner dates and treat them
like a gentleman would.

307
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:57,455
Then she'll expect the same
from the men in her future.

308
00:13:57,489 --> 00:13:58,990
Wait, let me
get this straight:

309
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:01,993
Sit <i>and</i> eat?
That's my punishment?

310
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:03,694
It's not a punishment.

311
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:05,896
But you can't just eat dinner.

312
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:09,266
You have to be gentlemanly
and attentive.

313
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:11,102
Oh, I can fake attentive.

314
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:13,804
I've been watching a football
game this whole discussion.

315
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,606
Not fake attentive.

316
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:17,174
Real attentive.

317
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:19,210
Okay, okay.
I'll make it fun.

318
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:21,379
I'll take her
to that crab place.

319
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:23,481
All the crabs
you could smash.

320
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:25,816
You know Lisa's
a vegetarian.

321
00:14:25,851 --> 00:14:27,284
She can smash a salad.

322
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,022
No. Homer, you can't just do
the things you want to do.

323
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:34,859
You have to act like someone
you'd want Lisa to marry.

324
00:14:34,893 --> 00:14:37,862
If you just act like yourself,
she might just...

325
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,130
um...

326
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,565
Oh, you know... um...

327
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,434
She might marry
someone like me?

328
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:46,704
You think that would be bad.

329
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:48,339
Homie, I love you.

330
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:50,141
But you can be
a challenge,

331
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:52,376
like doing the
Daily Jumble.

332
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:54,979
Marge, you are comparing me

333
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:58,149
to the most infuriating thing
in the newspaper!

334
00:14:58,183 --> 00:14:59,650
Well, I was
just trying to...

335
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:01,218
Oh...
I'm sleeping on

336
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:02,987
Flanders' couch tonight.

337
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:04,622
Ours is crap.

338
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,494
So Marge says I gotta
ask Lisa on a date.

339
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,863
Sure you remember how
to ask out a girl, Homer?

340
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:17,466
Yeah, you've been out of
the game a long time there.

341
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,734
Guys, lay off Homer.

342
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:20,135
Now you quit stalling

343
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,570
and call your
daughter like a man.

344
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:23,939
Oh... it feels weird.

345
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:25,874
Just ask your daughter
to have dinner with you.

346
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:28,010
What is the big deal?

347
00:15:28,044 --> 00:15:29,011
Ah, he's doing it!

348
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:30,345
He's calling a girl.

349
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,880
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God...

350
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:32,981
Oh, it's ringing.

351
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,483
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

352
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,484
Hello?

353
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,486
Uh, hello. Lisa?

354
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,654
I know your brother and...

355
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:39,655
Oh!

356
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,989
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

357
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,491
Calm down, calm down.

358
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,492
She doesn't know it's you.

359
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,727
Ah! Hide! Hide!

360
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,830
Uh, hello?

361
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,366
Oh, sure, Lisa, uh,
your dad's right here.

362
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,736
Dad?

363
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:55,737
Did you just call?

364
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:56,738
Uh, yeah.

365
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:58,540
Hey, listen, your mom thinks

366
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,509
that maybe you and I

367
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,178
should have dinner together
sometime.

368
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,579
Just the two of us?

369
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:06,581
Ah, yeah, I knew
you'd think it's dumb.

370
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:07,616
I'd love that.

371
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,017
See you tonight.

372
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,353
I got a date
with my daughter!

373
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,221
Yeah, we all
been there.

374
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:14,957
No need to act
like you just

375
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:16,258
invented air conditioning.

376
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:21,263
So, you see, Chief,

377
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:23,799
Snake wasn't stealing
that stuff out of greed.

378
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,268
He was stealing it
to thank me.

379
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:27,602
Plea denied.

380
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:29,771
Warm up the electric
chair, Lou.

381
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:32,274
You're not done yet?

382
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:33,942
The instructions
are in Swedish, Chief.

383
00:16:33,977 --> 00:16:35,877
We got this from IKILLYA.

384
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,779
Yo, I totally
speak Swedish.

385
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:38,780
Fluently?

386
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:40,415
Um, <i>ja.</i>

387
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,783
Uh, do what he says, Lou.

388
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:43,685
But Chief...
But-but-but.

389
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,555
Quit arguing and give
him the little wrench.

390
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,556
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

391
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,024
Let him out, Lou.
Let him out.

392
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,526
But Chief, we got guns;
he's got a little wrench.

393
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:52,761
It's cold!

394
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,429
Y... oh...

395
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,765
All right.

396
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,769
Thanks for coming down, Bart.

397
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:03,438
You won't need
to save me a third time.

398
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:04,539
You're going straight?

399
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:07,376
If I get caught,
it's suicide by cop.

400
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,077
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.

401
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,279
It means I get you
to shoot me, dude.

402
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:13,782
Yeah, still sounds like
a lot of paperwork.

403
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,986
Hair volumizer?!

404
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:19,221
Cologne?!

405
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:21,690
Hello, Marjorie.

406
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:22,924
Homie.

407
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,926
You look like
an NBA coach.

408
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,895
Yes, well, it's
a special evening

409
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:29,965
and I thought it best
not to look like a monkey.

410
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,466
Mm!

411
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:32,801
Don't worry.

412
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:34,536
I won't embarrass you.

413
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,538
I will put
my napkin in my lap,

414
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:38,707
I will use the utensils
provided for me,

415
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,609
and if I our food
is slow in coming,

416
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,011
I will "blow my stack"
in a manner

417
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:45,814
befitting the Earl
of Yarborough.

418
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:47,983
All right,
you've made your point.

419
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:49,718
Hey, I can't screw this up

420
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:52,821
or Lisa will get stuck
with someone like me.

421
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:56,291
Homie, I don't have
a problem with you.

422
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,294
Except your buttons
are off one.

423
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,530
Actually, this is
a collar button, see?

424
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:02,964
It goes like this...

425
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,600
Tuh! Is there no end
to your fault-finding?

426
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,770
Maggie, help me
with this shirt.

427
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,809
So Mr. Burns
never realized

428
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,244
it was Maggie
who saved the plant?

429
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,245
Nope.

430
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,580
Now, how's that drink?

431
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:20,115
Can I Temple up
that Shirley?

432
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:21,817
Oh, I'm fine.

433
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:24,586
Well, have we decided?

434
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,188
Uh, yeah, help me out here.

435
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:27,689
What is the normal amount

436
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:29,057
of entrees per person?

437
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:30,759
Eh, one, sir.

438
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:32,227
I mean for adults.

439
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:33,261
One.

440
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:35,864
No, I mean for
adult males.

441
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:38,033
Yes.
I repeat, eh, one.

442
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:40,502
All right,
I'll have the lasagna.

443
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,503
All right.

444
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,838
Meat or vegetarian?

445
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,673
Oh, uh... Oh...

446
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:45,941
Vegetarian.

447
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:49,344
Can the red
sauce be cow blood?

448
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,513
We'll see what
we can do.

449
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,948
Is that Mom?

450
00:18:52,982 --> 00:18:55,784
Homer, can you come
with me for a minute?

451
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,586
Marge, please,
control your jealousy.

452
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,187
This is your daughter.

453
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,189
We need to have
a conversation

454
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,791
in loud whispers.

455
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,392
Uh, excuse me, Lisa.

456
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:06,962
A friend from high school.

457
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,232
Homie, I felt terrible

458
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,367
when you said I felt
stuck with you.

459
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,869
But then I realized:

460
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,971
I <i>am</i> stuck with you.

461
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:18,707
I couldn't stop loving you
if I tried.

462
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,710
I'm sorry, that's all very nice.

463
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,712
But I can't forget
what you said.

464
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,013
I know, Homie.

465
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,581
I know you well
enough to know

466
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:28,550
you're not ready
to forgive me yet.

467
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,685
But I also know
you well enough

468
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,855
to know that
this will work.

469
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,357
Where'd you get
that dress?

470
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,627
Remember that
sewing machine

471
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:40,228
you say I
never use?

472
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,465
Well, I sold it and
bought this dress.

473
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:44,466
Wow...

474
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,468
Wow, that looks just like

475
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,537
the dress you wore
on <i>Project Runway.</i>

476
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:49,804
Shush-shush-shush.

477
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,906
Oh, right.

478
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,574
I mean, this looks like a dress

479
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,309
from a local Springfield store.

480
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:55,810
All is forgiven.

481
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:57,379
Let's have dinner.

482
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:04,553
Dad, I believe
<i>we</i> were on a date?

483
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:06,988
Oh, of course.
You're right, honey.

484
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:09,658
I'll just, um...
I'll park it at the bar.

485
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:14,229
Well, hello.

486
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:17,332
And your lasagna
with cow blood, sir.

487
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:18,500
Thanks, Frenchy.

488
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:20,902
I'm not French,
I'm just pissy.

489
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:25,943
Lucas.

490
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:28,025
You're not competitive
eating anymore?

491
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,193
No.

492
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,928
I realized that
was unrealistic.

493
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,263
Well, that's a relief.

494
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,932
My new goal is to become
whatever Adele is.

495
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,435
Just call me Pound-Uca-Dollar.

496
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,737
What if I just taught
you how to whistle?

497
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,038
You know how to whistle?

498
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,273
Like with your mouth?

499
00:20:45,296 --> 00:20:46,563
Hey, I'm doing it!

500
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:51,391
<i>I sound just like a bird!</i>
