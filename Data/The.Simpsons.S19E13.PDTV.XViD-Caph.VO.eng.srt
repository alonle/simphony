00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,493
The Simpsons S19E13 (KABF06)
- The Debarted -

2
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:08,733
The art teacher is fat, not pregnant.

3
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,764
Ow! Mom, Lisa hit me!

4
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:00,066
I did not!

5
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,521
Kids, knock it off.

6
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:05,031
I'm uncomfortable driving
your father's car as it is.

7
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,801
Taxicab License.

8
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:07,977
What the...?

9
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:15,913
Fine! We'll divide the car
into your side and my side.

10
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:17,320
My leg is the barrier.

11
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:20,139
Mom!

12
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:21,499
The system works!

13
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:26,775
It's not funny!

14
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:28,511
Your wearing cleats!

15
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,630
Stop it! Stop it!

16
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:49,203
Sorry I'm late...

17
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:50,581
I was in a car crash.

18
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:53,051
Many hurt,
but nobody cool was harmed.

19
00:01:53,056 --> 00:01:54,782
Just sit down, Bart.

20
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:55,822
Huh?!

21
00:01:58,135 --> 00:01:59,551
Who's the new
meat in my seat?

22
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:00,773
Bart, this is Donny...

23
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:04,123
he's here at our school because
he was kicked out of P.S. 132.

24
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:06,161
P.S. That school sucked.

25
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:08,901
Don't worry, Bart,

26
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:11,122
Willie's bringing you
something to sit on.

27
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:19,281
Hey, Krabappel,

28
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,421
your name sounds
like "crab apple."

29
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,830
Did you go sour waiting
for someone to pick you?

30
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,122
Pretty much.

31
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:31,201
Huh?

32
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,971
Isn't he awesome?

33
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:48,901
When he grows up,
I want to be like me!

34
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,711
Look, new kid,

35
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:54,382
I'm the head hamster in
this habitrail, capisce?

36
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,851
Well, maybe there's a new
guinea pig in your cage.

37
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:58,081
Capisce that?

38
00:02:58,086 --> 00:02:59,542
Oh, I capisce.

39
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,401
I capisce just fine.

40
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:04,140
Oh, well, you just
keep on capisce-ing.

41
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:13,932
See-saw!

42
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:19,202
Mr. Simpson, this damage
will take a week to fix.

43
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:22,441
While your car's in the shop,
uh, you can drive this loaner.

44
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:25,330
Loa... ner?

45
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:26,612
She's right here.

46
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:30,631
This is the kind of car
you see in commercials!

47
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,093
How much am I
paying for this?

48
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:35,642
- Nothing.
- Hm, it seems like a lot.

49
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:36,553
On the contrary.

50
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:39,243
The loaner car is complimentary.
It's standard policy.

51
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:40,792
Really? Oh!

52
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,141
You people are idiots!

53
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:48,273
That's the dumb...

54
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:52,712
What a stu...

55
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:55,170
I mean, that sounds fair.

56
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:56,602
Okay, so...

57
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,173
Look at you!
Idiots!

58
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:05,243
Driver of a loaner car

59
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,691
Much better than a

60
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:08,962
Driver of my normal car...

61
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,161
Whoa! Fancy wheels!

62
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,750
What song does the horn play?

63
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,732
None.

64
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:17,853
Classy.

65
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:19,632
Wha...?

66
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,731
Hey, boy, check out
my new car... huh?

67
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:27,260
Cut it out!

68
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,802
Want to take a ride
with your old man?

69
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:29,381
No.

70
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:32,142
Come on!
Come on!

71
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,200
Oh, come on!

72
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,673
Oh, fine.

73
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,593
What's the matter, son?

74
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:42,611
There's this new kid

75
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,793
at school who everyone thinks
is cooler than me.

76
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:46,323
Aw, don't give up, boy!

77
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,152
I believe in you, and not
just because I have to.

78
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,082
Really, Dad?

79
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:53,492
Son, I know when we first met,
we didn't really hit it off,

80
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:56,652
but since then I've really
come to respect you.

81
00:04:56,656 --> 00:04:59,993
And unlike love,
respect can't be bought.

82
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:00,833
You're right.

83
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:03,731
I'm gonna go to school tomorrow
and show everyone I'm awesome.

84
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,091
That's my boy.

85
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:07,881
Now let's watch the air
conditioner fight the heater.

86
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:14,312
Now let's add
the rear window defogger.

87
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,251
Twister!
Get down!

88
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:26,992
"Air Skinner" brings it up.

89
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,070
He bounces the ball repeatedly
in a dribbling type motion.

90
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:35,970
Foul!

91
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:38,861
Great, I fouled out.
Now can I go?

92
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:40,963
Nope, I grant you
five more fouls.

93
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:58,751
Top this, Donny.

94
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:05,031
Thank you, children.

95
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:08,203
Welcome to the unveiling of our
new school lunch purchasing plan,

96
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,581
known as the Flex Plan.

97
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:17,081
Students may spend
up to ten points per day

98
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:18,953
in up to four
of seven categories.

99
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:21,763
Unused points roll over week
to week but not month to month.

100
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:24,833
Categories not included :
meat, dairy, vegetables...

101
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:25,612
Wha...?

102
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:26,882
That's odd.

103
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,311
But, as a one-time occurrence,
no cause for alarm.

104
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:36,573
It's not funny;
these movements are involuntary.

105
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:44,343
This almost makes me want
to find out how magnets work.

106
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:24,051
Bart! Bart! Bart!
Bart! Bart! Bart!

107
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:27,021
Bart! Bart! Bart!
Bart! Bart! Bart!

108
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:30,722
Who did this?

109
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:33,912
Until I find out, no one is leaving
this mixed-use auditorium.

110
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:37,472
But some of us
have after-school care!

111
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:40,792
When I catch
the culprit and I will...

112
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:43,111
I'm gonna throw this away...

113
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:44,931
and use this instead!

114
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:50,311
Principal Skinner?

115
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:52,282
I did it.

116
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:57,063
Young man, my office, now!

117
00:07:58,496 --> 00:07:59,772
Huh?

118
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:01,882
Why did you take
the rap for me?

119
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:03,701
I don't know.
I like your style.

120
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,112
Well, remember this:

121
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:07,712
Bart Simpson takes care
of his friends.

122
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,700
Come see me when you get out.

123
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,662
Young man, brace yourself...

124
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,721
for some congratulations!

125
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:19,232
We did it!
You're in!

126
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:21,482
We finally have a man
on the inside.

127
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:26,252
We're gonna put Bart Simpson
away for a long, long time.

128
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:29,223
By law, the most we can give
him is a ten-day suspension.

129
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:31,380
Well, that's long to a kid!

130
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:35,700
All our other attempts
to get a spy inside

131
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,543
the Bart Simpson operation
have failed.

132
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:40,160
Uter, Ralph, Doug the
hip guidance counselor...

133
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,361
he was never the same after Bart
got through with him.

134
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:44,672
Your extracurriculars
are gonna need a lot

135
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:47,411
of work if you want
to get into Vanderbilt.

136
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:50,161
I'll get the goods
on this Simpson kid.

137
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:51,883
You have my word
as a snitch.

138
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:54,523
Oh. Here he comes.
Now this won't be easy,

139
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:55,793
but pretend I'm a jerk.

140
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:59,851
Young man, I'm gonna be on you
like a numerator on a denominator!

141
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:02,301
Let's take a ride.

142
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:03,991
I got a place with a view.

143
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,990
I've never seen
blue vines before.

144
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:12,129
They're only sold in Europe.
I know a guy.

145
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:16,979
Ah, yeah!

146
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:18,675
You can really taste the blue.

147
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:20,302
Check this out... Nyaa!

148
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:21,900
Oh, that's so cool!

149
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,823
Here's a little hair
of the dog for tomorrow.

150
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,550
Oh, thanks, Bart.

151
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:30,552
Now th we're buddies,
I can let you in on some of

152
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:32,163
the cool scams
we run at school.

153
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,571
Oh, yeah?
Like what?

154
00:09:33,758 --> 00:09:36,230
Bathroom passes,
doctor's notes...

155
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:40,131
We can rig a cootie catcher so
you can marry anybody you want.

156
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:44,753
Whoa! Sherri!
I'm in.

157
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:48,403
Milhouse, bust out four
of our finest juice boxes.

158
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,213
I just wanna say...

159
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:57,583
juice-box fight!

160
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:02,733
Sounds like fun.
Can I play?

161
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,722
Sure.

162
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:07,941
How is that fun?

163
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:10,311
Fun's only fun
if everyone's having fun.

164
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:11,511
Mom, what are you doing?

165
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:13,183
Honey, this is how I save money

166
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:14,431
on ketchup and mustard.

167
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:15,882
Do you do it with relish?

168
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:18,233
No, I'm kind of
embarrassed about it.

169
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:20,140
Mrs. Simpson, may I take you

170
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:21,573
for an evening drive?

171
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:23,573
Our loaner awaits.

172
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:27,101
Did you just unlock
the car from here?

173
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,840
<i>Baby, let's cruise</i>

174
00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:44,122
<i>Away from here...</i>

175
00:10:47,117 --> 00:10:50,391
<i>Don't be confused, baby</i>

176
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:56,220
<i>The way is clear</i>

177
00:10:57,718 --> 00:11:03,993
<i>And if you want it,
you got it forever</i>

178
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:07,980
<i>This is not
a one-night stand, baby...</i>

179
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,082
Hello. You've reached
the snug bug.

180
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:14,540
What do you mean
my car's ready?!

181
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:15,901
Well, you can keep it, 'cause

182
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,252
I'm never giving up this one.

183
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:18,793
Now why don't you enjoy

184
00:11:18,797 --> 00:11:20,181
the sounds of my wife

185
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:23,061
and me making sweet,
sweet love.

186
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:29,100
That wasn't us,
that was the transmission.

187
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,971
Box fight!
Box fight!

188
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:53,020
One whistle!
Two whistles!

189
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:57,542
I'm one whistle away
from three whistles, people!

190
00:11:57,855 --> 00:11:59,451
Faculty lounge

191
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,740
All right, here's the plan:
we go in there,

192
00:12:06,746 --> 00:12:08,821
fill the coffee pot with
crickets from this bag

193
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,862
labeled crickets and leave.

194
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:28,963
<i>I'm shipping up to Boston
Whoa-oh-oh</i>

195
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:32,602
<i>Shipping up to Boston
Whoa-oh-oh</i>

196
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:37,453
<i>I'm shipping off
to find my wooden leg</i>

197
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:47,552
<i>I'm a sailor peg,
and I lost my leg</i>

198
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:51,763
<i>Climbing up the topsails,
I lost my leg...</i>

199
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,112
Skinner's five steps

200
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:09,031
ahead of me.

201
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:10,571
I put a tack in his chair,

202
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:11,883
he's corked his pants!

203
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:14,670
I throw a tomato,
he's making salad!

204
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,732
I have some information
ye might be interested in.

205
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:20,681
But it won't be easy to hear.

206
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:21,963
Because of your stupid accent?

207
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,580
Nach-nae!

208
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:25,851
Because of its upsetting nature!

209
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,112
Skinner's gotten to
someone close to ye.

210
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:30,372
A rat.

211
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,392
- Who is it?
- I dunno.

212
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:33,641
But Skinner's goin' to

213
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,941
meet the rat right now.

214
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:40,033
Thanks, Willie.

215
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:42,721
A child thanked me!

216
00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:44,880
I gotta write this
in my journal.

217
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:46,851
Dear...

218
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:48,340
diary,

219
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:50,173
Today I've...

220
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:11,180
Got him.

221
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:37,823
Where am I?

222
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,763
You're in line
for a measle shot.

223
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:41,943
Okay, now we've made a

224
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:43,661
guide hole for the real needle.

225
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,052
Uh, Bart,
where are we going?

226
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:52,922
Gentlemen,

227
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,283
someone I thought I could trust

228
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:56,541
is a rat.

229
00:14:57,546 --> 00:14:58,833
Now, let's see.

230
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:00,561
Is it my
best friend,

231
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:02,230
my other best friend,

232
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,370
or a kid I just met?

233
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:06,181
Donny...

234
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:07,843
grab Milhouse's legs.

235
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:08,860
He's the rat.

236
00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:12,552
You grew tired
of always being in my shadow.

237
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:16,640
No, I like your shadow.
It's nice and cool.

238
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,300
Quit it! No!

239
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:24,780
Don't worry, we'll get him out
in a couple hours.

240
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:33,390
Oh, my Gosh.

241
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:36,330
It's an outhouse
sent from the future.

242
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:38,693
Hey, I'm in here.

243
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:41,211
Be quiet, Robo-potty.

244
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:42,970
Okay.

245
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:45,961
Now that we have taken care

246
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:46,982
of our rat problem,

247
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:48,282
Skinner can't stop us,

248
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:50,590
and I've got a prank I've
been planning for months.

249
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,593
We're going to egg Skinner's house.

250
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,180
We've already egged his car,

251
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:56,110
his office, and his father's grave.

252
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:57,511
How's this going to be different?

253
00:15:57,517 --> 00:16:00,560
Gentlemen,
this is an ostrich egg.

254
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:03,452
Normally,
you can't even buy these.

255
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,302
You have to buy
the ostrich and wait.

256
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:06,752
How much of this is gunk?

257
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,491
The whole insides.

258
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:12,800
Whoa, to think this came out
of some animal's butt.

259
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,762
Beautiful, in its way.

260
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:17,031
This car is amazing.

261
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:19,452
The radio lets me contribute

262
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,830
directly to NPR.

263
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:24,970
This is Terry Gross from NPR,
saying "Thank you. "

264
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:27,570
Now, let's get back
to our 1987 interview

265
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:29,181
with Senator Alan Cranston.

266
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:31,002
I never dreamed an American car

267
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:32,173
designed in Germany,

268
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:34,340
assembled in Mexico
from parts made in Canada

269
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:36,232
could be so amazing.

270
00:16:37,225 --> 00:16:39,511
Yeah, I can't believe
all those years

271
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:41,722
I used to drive
that old piece of...

272
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:42,590
What the...?

273
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,771
My old car.

274
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:47,650
So you're sure
this baby'll make

275
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:48,882
it out to the desert?

276
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:51,682
Sure. Why, what'd you
have in mind?

277
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:54,742
Well, we gonna start by shooting
her full of holes, and, uh,

278
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,420
then me and the boys are gonna

279
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:57,920
have a little fun with her.

280
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:01,232
I'll have you know I love this car

281
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:02,813
as if it were my own child.

282
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:07,242
Dad?

283
00:17:07,997 --> 00:17:09,691
Sorry, Maggie.

284
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,801
Say, Simpson, would you mind holding

285
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:17,312
one end of this banner

286
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:18,550
while I put it up?

287
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:21,162
My pleasure, sir.

288
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,621
We'll see who's laughing
when your house

289
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:30,332
is smeared with ostrich albumen.

290
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,260
Donny's the rat.

291
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:42,962
Where do you think you're going?

292
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:45,123
Ah, get back to your
knitting, Seymour.

293
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,052
I will, but it's because I want to.

294
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:55,232
So, guys,
before we hit Skinner's,

295
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,160
I want to make a quick stop.

296
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:06,711
Hey, Bart,

297
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:09,123
uh, what are we doing here?

298
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,673
There's been a change of plans.

299
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:13,313
I was going to tell you,
but then I remembered...

300
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:14,682
you're the rat!

301
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:16,820
No, no, no,
you got it all wrong.

302
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:18,873
Skinner's tongue was blue.

303
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:21,613
Blue from the vines you gave him.

304
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:23,481
Why'd you do it, man?

305
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:25,723
Look, you don't start
out wanting to be a rat.

306
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,841
Sometimes it's your only option.

307
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:30,262
Skinner and Chalmers wanted to get

308
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:32,060
someone inside your organization

309
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:33,733
someone with no history.

310
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,403
Too cute, too tall,

311
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:37,442
too Siamese, too Siamese.

312
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:38,622
How much for that one?

313
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:42,203
I'm sorry, Bart.

314
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,951
You were like a
brother to me.

315
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,201
We were going to take wood

316
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:46,780
shop together and make nunchucks.

317
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:48,641
And then take people to our lockers

318
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:50,131
and show them our nunchucks.

319
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:51,301
I know.

320
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:53,090
That would have been cool.

321
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,633
Are we going to fizz
this guy or what?

322
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,521
Fizz me?

323
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,562
A funny thing happens when

324
00:18:58,565 --> 00:19:00,830
you mix Mentos with Diet Coke.

325
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:07,383
Now imagine that times a million.

326
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,121
And it's all going to go down

327
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:15,502
in Skinner's office.

328
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:18,330
That's all we needed to hear.

329
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:21,472
Running away rules!

330
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:25,470
Sorry to plop, plop on your fizz, fizz.

331
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:27,342
What are you doing here?

332
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:30,333
I knew egging my house
was just a ploy.

333
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,892
You see, the rat who told
you about my rat

334
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:34,431
was also a rat.

335
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:37,322
It was rats within rats...

336
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:39,111
which was also me dinner last night.

337
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:41,570
Willie?!
You're on Skinner's side?!

338
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:42,922
He gave me something

339
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:44,130
you never could...

340
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:47,092
an elementary school diploma.

341
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:51,441
Bart, we're going to send
you to the toughest

342
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:53,823
juvenile detention center there is.

343
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:55,911
And it's all thanks to Donny here,

344
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,631
who can happily live the rest of his life

345
00:19:57,637 --> 00:19:59,342
knowing he betrayed the one boy

346
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:00,933
who actually cared about him.

347
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:24,520
Skinner!

348
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,830
- Skinner?
- I'm all right, sir.

349
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:29,183
Don't ever scare me
like that again.

350
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:31,891
Well, I guess we're even.

351
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:33,480
What are you going to do now?

352
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:35,931
What I always do...
survive.

353
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,613
Hey, we should get
together sometime.

354
00:20:38,615 --> 00:20:41,221
You know, to make nunchucks.

355
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:42,523
Sweet.

356
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,013
The rat symbolizes obviousness.
