with this guy
who looked like a gangbanger.

180
00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:01,454
All tatted up his neck,
big scar on his cheek.

181
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,556
Not the kind of guy
you ever see down here.

182
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,026
And he was handing Peter
a package about yea big.

183
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,495
When Peter saw me,
he looked guilty as hell.

184
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,764
So I just kept walking.

185
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,800
And you didn't ask him about it?

186
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,068
Yeah, I did later,

187
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,538
but he said it was nothing,
so I just let it go.

188
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,406
You saw a gangbanger in your stairwell,

189
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,608
and you just let it go?

190
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,911
This is a high-stress
environment, detective.

191
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,212
We don't ask a lot of questions

192
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,249
about what our people do to...
to get through the day.

193
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:32,517
Okay.

194
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,952
Do you think you can
describe him to a sketch artist?

195
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,086
I think so.

196
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,455
[ Cellphone beeps ]
Great.

197
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,389
I need the names of all of
Peter's associates here at work.

198
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,390
Of course.

199
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,891
Lanie's got something for us.

200
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,295
Lanie: Still no indication
of defensive wounds,

201
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,167
but I did find this when
I checked his nails for DNA.

202
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,137
Castle: Numbers.

203
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,605
"7, 2, 3, 5, 9, 8."

204
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,741
He wrote it in pen
I'd say four or five days ago.

205
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,478
But that's not why I called you.

206
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:02,212
Look at this.

207
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:05,716
On his chest, next to the "Y" incision.

208
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:10,087
- Look at what?
- It's subtle...

209
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:12,489
so subtle, I almost missed it.

210
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:15,292
But I think it explains
why his shirt was ripped open.

211
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:18,962
- You see this grainy material?
- Yeah.

212
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:20,597
It's adhesive residue.

213
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:22,165
In fact, there's a residue pattern

214
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,766
from his belly to his chest.

215
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:24,834
Adhesive?

216
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:25,935
Mm-hmm.

217
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,236
Looking at the pattern,

218
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,190
I'd say your Wall Street wolf
was wearing a wire.

219
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,742
Gates: A wire?

220
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:34,243
Beckett: Yes, sir.

221
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:35,378
We believe our killer removed it

222
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:36,445
from the victim's body
after shooting him.

223
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,481
Do we know who
he was wearing a wire for?

224
00:08:38,516 --> 00:08:39,782
Well, we're checking

225
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,751
with other branches
of law enforcement right now.

226
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:43,752
What about this woman
who called in the murder?

227
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:44,920
Have you been able to identify her?

228
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:46,188
You know, no one in Cordero's life

229
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:47,923
seems to know who she is,

230
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:49,791
and we have no idea where to find her.

231
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:52,395
I... think she just found us.

232
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:55,531
Oh, Lord.

233
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:58,501
I'd say your case
just got a lot more complicated.

234
00:08:58,535 --> 00:08:59,668
What is it, sir?

235
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:02,103
They're from the U.S. Attorney's Office.

236
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:03,138
You know them?

237
00:09:03,172 --> 00:09:04,506
Uh, not the woman from the photo,

238
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,542
but the woman with her
is Elizabeth Weston,

239
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:09,945
the U.S. Attorney
for the Southern District.

240
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:13,114

Yes, it has.

And who is this?

246
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,327
I'm Stefanie Goldmark,
Assistant U.S. Attorney.

247
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:43,262
We're here about the Cordero murder.

248
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,923
Oh, well, that's funny,

249
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,257
because we have a few questions
about that ourselves.

250
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:49,159
Beckett: Starting, Ms. Goldmark,

251
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:50,561
with why you didn't identify yourself

252
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:52,997
when you made that 911 call
from the pay phone.

253
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,334
Because I instructed her not to.

254
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:01,305
I couldn't afford to
compromise our investigation.

255
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:02,406
What investigation?

256
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:07,177
Is there somewhere private we can talk?

257
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:12,816
All right, Elizabeth,
what's this all about?

258
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,685
Your victim was a confidential
informant for my office

259
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,522
in an ongoing criminal
investigation of JP Harding.

260
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:21,958
Which is why Cordero was wearing a wire.

261
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:23,693
Yes, and since JP Harding
is on the 65th floor,

262
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:25,194
we couldn't monitor it live.

263
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:28,297
Cordero put it on every morning
and turned it in every night,

264
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:30,634
along with the attached
recording device.

265
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:32,035
Only last night, he didn't.

266
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:34,370
I went to his apartment
to see what happened.

267
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:38,141
That's when I found him,
and the wire was gone.

268
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:39,575
We think that there was something key

269
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,310
to our investigation on that wire
and that's why he was killed.

270
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:42,678
So where are you on leads?

271
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:46,048
[ Sighs ]

272
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:47,283
Well, uh, ballistics
is running the slug,

273
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:49,385
but right now the only lead
is this sketch,

274
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:52,255
provided by Mr. Cordero's boss,
Jamie Berman.

275
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:54,957
It's of a man he saw with our victim.

276
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:56,625
Well, I wouldn't put
much credence in that sketch.

277
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,160
Why? Why is that?

278
00:10:58,194 --> 00:11:01,964
Because Berman is the target
of our investigation.

279
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,799
Jamie Berman, head of JP Harding?

280
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,801
We've been trying to mount
a case against him for years...

281
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:07,069
insider trading, securities fraud.

282
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:08,570
We know he's doing it.

283
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:10,172
We just haven't been able to get proof.

284
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:12,307
Not without getting inside.

285
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:13,708
Berman's too careful.

286
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:15,710
Then, last month, we caught a break.

287
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:17,512
Peter Cordero was found
with a baggie of cocaine

288
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:18,813
during a stop-and-frisk.

289
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:21,849
With his priors for possession
when he was a teen,

290
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:23,017
he was facing 5 to 10.

291
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,986
You got Cordero to play ball.

292
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,921
He jumped at an immunity deal.

293
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:28,890
He'd already gotten valuable information

294
00:11:28,924 --> 00:11:29,991
on his wire recordings.

295
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:32,359
But yesterday, he was scheduled

296
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:33,634
to meet with Berman one-on-one.

297
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:35,296
He was gonna push him to open up
about some of his deals.

298
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,131
Cordero may have pushed too hard.

299
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:41,135
We think Berman made
Cordero in that meeting.

300
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,804
So you think Jamie Berman's
somehow responsible

301
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:44,805
for Cordero's death?

302
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,006
Well, if Berman knew

303
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,275
he had incriminated himself on tape...

304
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,977
He'd go to any lengths to get it back.

305
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:53,714
Victoria, this investigation is ongoing,

306
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,584
and exposing it to Mr. Berman
or anyone at JP Harding

307
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:58,485
would break federal statutes.

308
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,486
But I thought that this was something

309
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,789
that you and your team needed to know.

310
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:04,024
I'd certainly say so.

311
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,793
So I trust that you will keep
my office in the loop

312
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:09,162
if there are any...
significant developments.

313
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:10,897
Is that clear?

314
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:12,298
Of course.

315
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,008
Sir, I didn't...
I didn't know you had a sister.

316
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,478
Oh, well, now you do.

317
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:33,619
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District?

318
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,821
That's a really big deal.

319
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,757
Why hasn't Gates
ever mentioned her before?

320
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,092
I don't know, but there was
definitely a subtle chill

321
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,293
between the two of them.

322
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,694
"A subtle chill"?

323
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,097
More like a polar vortex.

324
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:48,134
I'm guessing something happened
between them in the past...

325
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,534
something deeply personal

326
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,371
that Gates does not want us
to know about.

327
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,139
I'll give you a dollar if you ask her.

328
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,141
- No way.
- Come on. Aren't you curious?

329
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,842
Yeah, but I like my job too much.

330
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,478
Hey, so, uh, there may be something

331
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,912
to the U.S. Attorney's theory.

332
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,381
I checked Cordero's calendar.

333
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:03,749
He was scheduled to meet with Berman

334
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,083
at 5:00 P.M. yesterday.

335
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,684
And whatever they talked about,
it got heated.

336
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:07,786
How do you know that?

337
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,453
According to building security,

338
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,622
the two of them left shortly after

339
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,892
and seemed to be
in the middle of a fight.

340
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,333
Yeah, Peter and I had words yesterday.

341
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,334
So what?

342
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:25,068
So, you didn't tell us about that

343
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:27,070
- when we talked this morning.
- 'Cause it wasn't relevant.

344
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:28,238
Castle: How is it not relevant?

345
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:29,674
The video shows you leaving together.

346
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,874
Two hours later, he's dead.

347
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:33,344
It's not relevant
because I didn't kill him.

348
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:37,748
Honestly, detective,
what would be my motive?

349
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,917
What exactly were the two of you
arguing about?

350
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,285
A business deal.

351
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:44,063
You looked pretty worked up
for a business deal.

352
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:46,123
There was a lot riding on it.

353

Love to.

709
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:29,615
Let me get <i>my</i> list.

710
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:33,418
Oh, you know, I had no idea how
many people I needed to invite

711
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:34,986

712
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,121
Mm.

[ Elevator dings ]
Good news.

716
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:41,087
I crossed-referenced
my mother's list with my list.

717
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:42,722
We have three names in common.

718
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:45,696
Wow, three names. That's... great.

719
00:28:45,712 --> 00:28:48,998
That takes us from, what, 585 to 582?

720
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:51,115
There's got to be
a better way to cut this down.

721
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,983
Ryan, you guys kept your wedding small.

722
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:54,519
What was it... like 100 people?

723
00:28:54,553 --> 00:28:56,054
Yeah, that's all we could afford.

724
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:58,389
How did you contain the list?

725
00:28:58,424 --> 00:28:59,657
[ Inhales deeply ]

726
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:01,331
I have a lot of relatives
who hate me now.

727
00:29:02,226 --> 00:29:06,129
So, the warrant on Cordero's
phone finally came through.

728
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:07,698
Whoever this Armando Garcia is,

729
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:08,899
it has something to do with Venezuela.

730
00:29:08,934 --> 00:29:11,101
That's where Peter was from.

731
00:29:11,135 --> 00:29:12,703
Yeah, that first call
confirming the $25 million?

732
00:29:12,737 --> 00:29:14,271
It was made to a bank in Venezuela.

733
00:29:14,305 --> 00:29:16,173
The second call
was to the Venezuela Consulate

734
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:17,507
right here in the city.

735
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:18,675
It was the direct line
of a senior official there...

736
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:21,144
a Luis Delgado.

all circling around
the mysterious Armando Garcia.

00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:32,556
What was Cordero doing?

741
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,657
I don't know,
but I can't wait to find out.

742
00:29:34,692 --> 00:29:38,595
Swiss bank accounts,
secret money transfers...

743
00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:41,397
it's got international intrigue
written all over it.

744
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:44,467
It was just a simple passport request.

745
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,268
A passport request?

746
00:29:46,303 --> 00:29:47,637
Yes, that's why he called.

747
00:29:47,671 --> 00:29:49,305
Well, what about the money?

748
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:52,475
I'm afraid I don't know
anything about any money.

749
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:53,809
Really?

750
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:56,004
I suppose you've never heard of
Armando Garcia, either?

751
00:29:56,012 --> 00:29:57,480
Armando Garcia?

752
00:29:57,514 --> 00:30:00,316
Yes, of course

Both: You have?

754
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,852
That's who I got the passport for.

755
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:07,856
Wait, I thought that the
passport was for Peter Cordero.

756
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,626
Yes, Peter Cordero, Armando Garcia...

757
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:16,564
...it's the same guy.

758
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,233
He changed his name to fit in.

759
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:22,004
But his birth name was Armando Garcia.

760
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,574
He was sending the money to himself.

761
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:29,377
You said he was requesting a passport.

762
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,978
A Venezuelan passport?

763
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:32,347
Yes, of course.

764
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:36,684
Cordero applied to re-establish
his Venezuelan citizenship,

765
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:38,586
and we were more than happy to oblige.

766
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:40,588
Under the name "Armando Garcia"?

767
00:30:40,623 --> 00:30:42,857
That's right. But, uh...

768
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:45,960
there was something odd
about his request.

769
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:48,262
He asked to pick up the passport
in Mexico City.

770
00:30:48,296 --> 00:30:51,932
Mexico City? Did he say why?

771
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:53,934
No, but he was supposed to
get it yesterday

772
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:56,170
at our embassy there.

773
00:30:56,204 --> 00:30:57,237
He had booked a flight

774
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,838
from Mexico City to Caracas that night.

Not just running away,

changing his identity completely.

778
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:07,013
He never intended to testify.

779
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:08,982
He was just stringing my sister along

780
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:10,116
until he could escape.

781
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:12,085
All he had to do was drive to Mexico.

782
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,920
Once he boarded that flight to Caracas

783
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:16,422
under his new identity,
paid for with a new credit card,

784
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:18,058
Peter Cordero would cease to exist.

785
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:19,625
Your sister would never find him.

Beckett: But he wasn't
gonna leave empty-handed,

787
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:23,462

along with the $25 million.

You don't just conjure
$25 million out of thin air.

792
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:32,438
It came from somewhere.

793
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:33,972
And, given the circumstances,
nowhere legal.

794
00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:36,909
If you're right,
it'll destroy my sister's case.

795
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:39,078
All his testimony will be tainted.

Sir, what do you want us to do?

797

Find the truth.

798
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,884
In order to do that, we need to know

799
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:47,953
where the money came from,
and there's no way to find out.

800

You know that secret
Armando Garcia credit card?

You know, the one he used
to buy the plane ticket?

803
00:31:54,928 --> 00:31:56,628
We found another charge on it

that $25 million showed up
in his account.

807
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:05,737

was related to the transfer.

That cafe has security video.

If we can get a look
at the computer screen

or Peter's fingers on the keyboard,

811
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,110
maybe we can figure out
where that money came from.

812
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:13,478
And why he was killed.

her case is compromised
without her blaming me.

Why would she blame you
when you're just doing you job?

to the case, but...

off the very bust

And when my office
caught him re-selling it,

she came to me,
begged me not to file charges,

00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:18,641

the $25 million got into
Cordero's Swiss bank account.

845
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:01,282
It's him. He transferred
the money to Cordero.

Wait. That's Cordero's boss.
That's Jamie Berman.

00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:19,132
Why would Berman secretly pay
Cordero $25 million?

854
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,968
Only one reason.

855
00:34:21,002 --> 00:34:22,035
Cordero must have told Berman

about the U.S. Attorney's investigation.

857
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:26,723
And Berman was paying him
to throw the case.

00:34:36,938 --> 00:34:38,779
If Berman was paying Cordero
to throw the case,

859
00:34:38,804 --> 00:34:41,726
then the recordings
from his wire were all lies.

860

And if Elizabeth

All this time, my sister thought
she was taking down Berman

when he was really trying
to take down <i>her.</i>

The one thing
it doesn't explain, though,

869
00:35:00,134 --> 00:35:02,035
is why Cordero was killed.

870
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:03,870
Berman's up to his eyeballs in this.

$25 million showed up

You have no evidence that
account belongs to Mr. Cordero,

00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:35,834
I think there's a reason
why you went out of you way

883
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,303
to keep that transfer a secret.

884
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:39,472
I think Cordero told you
that he was being forced

885
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:41,440
to be an informant
for the U.S. Attorney.

886
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:44,176
And knowing that he would never
be able to work again,

887
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,811
he struck a deal with you.

888
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:49,281
$25 million in exchange
for providing false evidence

889
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:51,616
to undermine the investigation.

890
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:52,717
What investigation?

891
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:54,386
You know exactly what investigation.

892
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,155
And when you found out that he
wasn't gonna finish the job...

893
00:35:56,189 --> 00:35:58,690
that he was gonna leave town
and take your money with him...

894
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,125
you had him killed.

895
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,727
And then you took the wire
that you knew he was wearing

896
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:04,929
to cover up any recorded
evidence of the murder.

897
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:07,666
That's all wild speculation.

898
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,669
Not to mention,
you have your facts wrong.

899
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:16,574
You said Peter was wearing
his wire when he was killed.

900
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:19,344
I'm afraid that's not possible.

901
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:20,812
So you knew about the wire?

902
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,286
You admit you were in on it with him.

903
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:23,547
Jamie.

904
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,549
It's not illegal to know.

905
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,583
And I guarantee you

906
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,419
you will never link me to that payment,

907
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:30,621
so you'll never be able
to prove witness tampering.

908
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,790
But, yeah, I knew about the wire.

909
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:35,526
And Peter wasn't wearing it
when he was killed

910
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,195
because he had already left it
for the feds

911
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,798
at the dead drop
at Lafayette and Spring.

912
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,700
How do you even...

913
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,903
The walk that you took together.

914
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,839
You were with him.

915
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,208
I saw him go into the Mailbox door

916
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,676
and put it into one of those boxes.

917
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,182
Thank you for coming.

918
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,284
Of course.

919
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,418
There's been a break in the case?

920
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,254
Beckett: Yes, actually.

921
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,488
New information has surfaced

922
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,824
about Peter Cordero's murder.

923
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,760
In fact, it seems someone
in the U.S. Attorney's Office

924
00:37:10,794 --> 00:37:13,329
lied about Cordero not leaving his wire

925
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,565
at the dead drop the night of his death.

926
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,733
No one lied.

927
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,901
I went to the drop myself.
It wasn't there.

928
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,738
Elizabeth?

929
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,941
Tell her.

930
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:29,912
Stefanie, if Peter
never turned in his wire,

931
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:33,415
how did that day's recordings
end up on your computer?

932
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:36,651
See, even though you erased them,

933
00:37:36,686 --> 00:37:39,922
the tech department here
was able to recover...

934
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:41,257
everything.

935
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,091
I don't know what you're talking about.

936
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:45,260
Standard procedure was to turn them over

937
00:37:45,294 --> 00:37:47,228
for analysis the next morning.

938
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:49,798
But you listened to
those tapes that night,

939
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:51,566
and you heard something
you weren't supposed to,

940
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:53,268
at least not until Cordero was gone.

941
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:57,639
Cordero: <i>I came to the U.S.
believing in the American dream.</i>

942
00:37:57,673 --> 00:38:01,409
<i>So I worked hard and tried to</i>
<i>be honest in a corrupt world,</i>

943
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:02,743
<i>working for corrupt and greedy people,</i>

944
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:05,446
<i>because I still believed.</i>

945
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,782
<i>But when you, the U.S. Government,</i>

946
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:10,618
<i>plants drugs on me,</i>
<i>threatens to destroy my future,</i>

947
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:13,521
<i>all because you need someone to testify,</i>

948
00:38:13,555 --> 00:38:16,089
<i>how am I supposed to still believe?</i>

949
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:18,959
<i>I did everything I could</i>
<i>to play by the rules,</i>

950
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:20,394
<i>but no one else does.</i>

951
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:23,997
<i>So by the time you hear this,</i>
<i>I'll be gone.</i>

952
00:38:28,703 --> 00:38:30,704
We brought in the cop
that busted Cordero.

953
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:36,876
He confessed to planting
the cocaine... on your orders.

954
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:38,578
Why, Stefanie?

955
00:38:40,381 --> 00:38:43,150
You said you needed someone
on the inside,

956
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:46,954
to make the case against Berman,
for the greater good.

957
00:38:46,988 --> 00:38:50,323
No.
[ Sighs ] Not like this.

958
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:52,325
When you heard that recording

959
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:53,793
and found out Peter was leaving,

960
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:55,194
you knew it would all come out.

961
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:56,796
So you went to his place.

962
00:38:56,831 --> 00:38:59,466
I... I went to try and talk to him,
but he wouldn't listen.

963
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,401
And then you saw his gun,

964
00:39:02,436 --> 00:39:05,571
and you made sure that his story
would never get out.

965
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:07,206
And then you made it look like

966
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,442
he was killed for that recording.

967
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,852
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle.

968
00:39:19,886 --> 00:39:22,354
I would like to commend you
for your exemplary work

969
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:24,756
in the face of head winds
from me and my office.

970
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:25,924
Oh, thank you.

971
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:28,093
But, I mean, we were just
all doing our jobs,

972
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:29,427
following our Captain's lead.

973
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:34,199
Did you manage to track down
that $25 million?

974
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:36,034
Yes, it turns out that Mr. Cordero

975
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:38,870
donated a large portion of it
to rebuild his hometown...

976
00:39:38,904 --> 00:39:40,405
the one that was destroyed

977
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:41,906
in the earthquake
that killed his parents.

978
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,808
Are you gonna try to recover it?

979
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:46,077
Well, it's very difficult
to reclaim funds

980
00:39:46,112 --> 00:39:47,979
once they've left the country.

981
00:39:48,014 --> 00:39:51,716
Think that we have better uses
for our resources.

982
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,652
I should be going, but thank you again.

983
00:39:56,989 --> 00:40:00,057
What about Berman?
Do you still have a case?

984
00:40:00,091 --> 00:40:01,425
Well, not the one that I thought,

985
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:03,260
but at least I won't embarrass
myself in court

986
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:05,295
presenting evidence that's untrue.

987
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,765
Then Berman paid
$25 million for nothing.

988
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:10,067
Bet that hurt.

989
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:11,502
Probably, but it's not enough.

990
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:13,203
We will build our case the right way.

991
00:40:13,238 --> 00:40:15,539
It may take some time,
but we'll get him.

992
00:40:15,573 --> 00:40:17,441
Thank you, Victoria.

993
00:40:17,475 --> 00:40:19,076
For what?

994
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,645
For doing your job so well.

995
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:25,449
So, I know it's... it's late

996
00:40:25,483 --> 00:40:26,917
and you probably want to get home,

997
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:29,519
but after today,
I could really use a drink...

998
00:40:30,755 --> 00:40:32,121
...and a sister.

999
00:40:33,691 --> 00:40:35,491
Me too.

1000
00:40:44,268 --> 00:40:46,936
You know, in the end,
Gates' sister wasn't that bad.

1001
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,871
Does that mean we have
to invite her to the wedding?

1002
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,474
Yeah, what about that... our lists?

1003
00:40:51,508 --> 00:40:53,042
Castle, we can't have
that many people coming.

1004
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:54,843
Agreed. So, what do we do?

1005
00:40:54,878 --> 00:40:56,045
I think we have to decide

1006
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,047
<i>why</i> we're actually having this wedding.

1007
00:40:58,082 --> 00:40:59,315
I mean, are we doing this

1008
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:01,083
<i>not</i> to insult hundreds of people

1009
00:41:01,117 --> 00:41:02,651
or are we doing this for us?

1010
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:04,486
Well, for us.

1011
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,321
Well, then, why don't we
just take a minute

1012
00:41:06,355 --> 00:41:08,190
and write down the names
of all the people

1013
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:10,926
that absolutely, positively
have to be there,

1014
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:13,261
no matter what, to make us happy?

1015
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:14,496
One minute.

1016
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,764
Yeah.

1017
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:18,200
That's not much time.
What if we forget someone?

1018
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:20,602
Then they shouldn't have been
invited in the first place.

1019
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,572
Let's do it.

1020
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,273
Okay.

1021
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:27,875
All right.

1022
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,877
- Are we ready?
- Yep.

1023
00:41:29,912 --> 00:41:31,746
One minute.

1024
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,181
And go.

1025
00:41:35,985 --> 00:41:38,052
You stopped writing.

1026
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:41,122
So did you.

1027
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,829
[ Both chuckle ]

1028
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,700
Of course...

1029
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:57,137
I'm going to have to invite
my mother and Alexis.

1030
00:41:57,171 --> 00:41:59,572
- Yeah, and my dad and aunt Theresa.
- Right.

1031
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:02,408
Espo and Ryan, who will bring Jenny.

1032
00:42:02,443 --> 00:42:03,576
Mm-hmm. Lanie.

1033
00:42:03,611 --> 00:42:04,977
Lanie.

1034
00:42:05,012 --> 00:42:06,912
I'm gonna have to invite
the poker group.

1035
00:42:06,947 --> 00:42:09,382
- Yeah, Maddie.
- Gates.

1036
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:11,618
Ooh! And Gates' family.
