00:00:02,938 --> 00:00:07,353
Also, with the laparoscopic
common bile duct exploration,

post-op bile leaks and strictures

3
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:11,803
are significantly minimized.

4
00:00:12,123 --> 00:00:16,193
It was called, at the time,
an "audacious technique".

5
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:18,628
<i>- And it was.
- [Laughter]</i>

6

7
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:22,164
<i>Some context for you.</i>

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,280
<i>I was the only woman in my
surgical residency program.</i>

9
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:29,158
<i>They called me "girl" and "Mrs. Grey."</i>

10
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:30,236
<i>[Laughter]</i>

11
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:33,461
<i>Along with the one black male resident,</i>

12
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:35,445
<i>I was clearly excluded.</i>

13
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,743
<i>They didn't want me to be
a part of their boys' club.</i>

14
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:40,549
<i>So I did the only
audacious thing you can do</i>

15
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,018
<i>with an audacious technique.</i>

16
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:43,219
<i>I got myself published</i>

17
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:44,887
<i>in the Journal of American Medicine."</i>

18
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:47,578
<i>That caused an uproar.</i>

19
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:52,150
<i>A resident was not first
author of a published paper.</i>

20
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,777
<i>But the truly audacious
part came when they saw</i>

21
00:00:55,802 --> 00:01:00,531
<i>what I named my
technique... the Grey method.</i>

22
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,371
<i>I put my own name on it.</i>

23
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:06,302
<i>You should have heard
the boys roar about that.</i>

24
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:08,395
<i>[Laughter, applause]</i>

25
00:01:08,844 --> 00:01:12,065
<i>The first time I won the Harper Avery,</i>

26
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:16,818

mother wanted to be remembered.</i>

<i>My memory of her is...
A little bit different.</i>

Ellis: Where is the
chief?! You're all amateurs!

32
00:01:30,498 --> 00:01:32,166
Woman: Complaining of
intermittent cramping...

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,634
What the hell are you doing
here? Haven't I told you?

34
00:01:34,669 --> 00:01:35,902
How many times have I
told you not to bother me

35
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:37,362
when I'm at work?!

36
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:42,476
<i>I'm sure everyone remembers
their own version of her...</i>

[Crying] No.

00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:56,950
<i>But that's the tricky thing...</i>

Meredith.

Meredith, get up.

<i>- And another.
- [Baby crying]</i>

long, inescapable moment.</i>

<i>The carousel never stops turning.</i>

Meredith: I spent the day with Alex.

55
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:31,624
I needed a day, Derek, so I took it.

56
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:33,558
That's fine. I just need to know why.

57
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:36,028
No, you don't. You want
to hear that I cured cancer

58
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:38,363
or that I found a vaccine
for ALS before breakfast.

59
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:40,032
That'd be great. Anything would be great.

60
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:41,299
- There it is again.
- What?

61
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:43,168
You're waiting for me to pay up

62
00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:46,071
for this grand sacrifice
that you made for our family.

63
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:48,343
How am I supposed to do
anything with you pressuring me

64
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,702
and hovering over me for
a decision that you made?

65
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,391
And you're waiting for me to fail.

66
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,650
I'm waiting for you to shine.

67
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,374
Remember? That's why you're staying here.

68
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:59,259
And I told you, you should
go to D.C. and shine there.

69
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:02,119
It was you who decided to
stay here and martyr yourself

70
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:04,548
and now make me feel guilty
because of a decision you made.

71
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:05,573
Well, I am done.

72
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:06,966
I'm done feeling guilty,

73
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:09,641
and I am done measuring my
accomplishments against yours.

74
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,966
I won't do it anymore.

75
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,749
Just stay out of my way.

76
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:15,332
Wow. You sound just like your mother.

77
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,517
What happened to you?

78
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:19,842
Listen to me, Meredith...

79
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,579
<i>Anyone can fall in love
and be blindly happy,</i>

80
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:25,155
but not everyone can pick up a scalpel

81
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:26,423
and save a life.

82
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:29,693
I raised you to be an
extraordinary human being.

83
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:32,396
So imagine my disappointment
when I wake up after five years

84
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,026
and discover that you're
no more than ordinary.

85
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,426

I didn't hear you
complaining a few minutes ago.

90
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,279
I heard something.

91
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,231
I wouldn't call it complaining.

92

Don't be naive.

98
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:05,361
Seattle's a small city
with a small-town mentality.

99
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:07,667
So let's leave Seattle.

Nothing.

- Nothing. That's great.

Just, um... well, I thought
Bailey won the board seat.

110
00:04:38,392 --> 00:04:39,526
She did.

111
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,677

Oh! That's great.

00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:46,267
That's really good. That's awesome for you.

- Congratulations, man.
- Okay, you know what?

115

Shut it. I am a great surgeon.

It's not like they're doing me
a favor. I'm doing them a favor.

Besides, Robbins told me that
board vote was very close.

I will assign you to

his liver enzymes are looking good,

but I'm worried he might have
to go back in for an ERCP,

first Russell, then Yang, now Pierce?

Yang and I busted our
asses interviewing people,

and now I have to start
this whole process over?

149
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,410
Well, evidently, because it looks like

150
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:56,468
we hire from week to week.

151
00:05:56,502 --> 00:05:57,727

00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:00,338
Uh, yeah, I just read the e-mail.

154
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:01,397
Well, what should we do?

155
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,275
I don't see anything we can do.

156
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,045
Well... I mean, we should talk to her.

00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,398

We... okay, well, I didn't mean you!

159
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:10,996
I meant all of us!

160
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,284
We should get the whole board together,

161
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,385
do a full-court press.

162
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,220
Uh, yeah, yeah. You spearhead that.

Well, I will.

164

Lucky for you, the board just
got a transfusion of new blood.

from looking like a clown car.

Will you at least tell
me why you're leaving?

00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:37,736
Meredith...

354
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:42,186
- Ellis: You grew up.
- I did.

355
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:44,540
Hmm. It's a shame.

356
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,280
It's awful being a grown-up.

357
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:50,500
But the carousel never stops turning.

358
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:53,590
You can't get off.

359
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:58,012
- [Water running]
- Richard: You page me?

360
00:13:58,142 --> 00:13:59,326
What do you got?

361
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:00,717
Yeah.

362
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:04,112
Do you remember the day you
met my mom at the carousel?

363
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,069
What? That... that's what you...

364
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:08,503
I remember this day.

365
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:12,177
I was on the carousel
at the park and you came

366
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:15,504
and then you were arguing
and she said something to you.

367
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,497
Do you remember what she said?

368
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,096
Meredith, that was a long time ago.

369
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:24,087
[Sighs]

370
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:26,013
I-I don't remember.

371
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:28,671
Is that all you wanted?

372
00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:31,570
Yeah, I just thought...

373
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:35,577
Forget it.

374
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:37,713
[Sighs heavily]

375
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,224
I was thinking about what you said,

376
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,016
and it might be better for them...

377
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,209
Thatcher and Adele... ultimately.

378
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:49,468
Of course it would.

379
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:51,711
Let them findpeople who make them happy.

380
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:53,437
I never wanted to...

381
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:01,436
I never wanted to cheat...

382
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,829
Never imagined myself a cheater.

383
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:06,456
You have the power to change that, Richard.

384
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:07,681
It's in your hands.

385
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:10,772
I've been ready to do this for a long time.

386
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,496
The question is, are you?

387
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:19,752
[Sighs] The wife gave consent.

388
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:22,262
That's lucky. I've been in
his chest for a while now.

389
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:23,320
That was a bold bet.

390
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:24,945
Wait. Is... is that an aneurysm sac?

391
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,970
Did you just fix that?

392
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:27,295
Yeah, but now I'm gonna use it

393
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,218
to bring blood back to the spinal cord.

394
00:15:29,364 --> 00:15:30,942
Wait. I'm lost.

395
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,801
Yeah. I was, too, for a while.

396
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:34,396
He is paralyzed because his aorta

397
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:35,730
isn't sending blood to his spine.

398
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:37,790
So I replaced the aorta
with a Dacron graft,

399
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:41,314
and now I'm rebuilding the
aneurysm into a second aorta

400
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,507
that will just send blood to the spine,

401
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:44,826
kind of like a side road.

402
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:46,430
Is that... you can do that?

403
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:48,024
Not many could, but she is.

404
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:50,016
I can see why you want to keep her around.

405
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:51,918
Well, yeah, and...

406
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,252
Never mind.

407
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,921
And it'll work?

408
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:56,155
God knows.

409
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,657
It's a last-ditch effort.

410
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:00,565
Take me with you when you go.

411
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,586
Suction. And get another
6-0 of prolene ready.

412
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:06,832
Well, don't just stand
there, Wilson. Scrub in.

413
00:16:09,393 --> 00:16:12,428
Meredith: Okay, the tumor has
taken over the abdominal cavity.

414
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:14,283
It's pushed the viscera over to one side.

415
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,356
Let's de-bulk as much of
this mass as we can, unblock,

416
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:19,616
and when we get closer to the organs,

417
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,375
we can resect it piece by piece.

418
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,433
Fine.

419
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:24,827
What?

420
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,903
Edwards told me.

421
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:29,263
You guys were unanimous for Bailey.

422
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,488
Who told you that?

423
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:32,701
- Dr. Bailey.
- Why would she do that?

424
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,906
- I kind of had her back.
- And you should have had mine.

425
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:36,674
You listened to my speech.
You said it was good.

426
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:38,388
- It was good.
- Then what the hell, then?

427
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:40,233
- Bailey's was better.
- Well, that's great.

428
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:42,526
Alex, you would make a fine board member,

429
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:45,072
but Bailey will make an exceptional one.

430
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:46,829
Is that what you want me to do...

431
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:49,488
vote for you to be good, to be fine?

432
00:16:49,513 --> 00:16:51,179
You want my pity vote?

433
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:52,831
I wouldn't.

434
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:04,069
- Okay.
- He is coming around.

435
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:06,063
Want to do the honors?

436
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:10,428
Roy. Roy, are you with us?

437
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:11,779
[Groaning]

438
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:13,951
Roy, you're okay. The surgery is all done.

439
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:16,010
I just need you to wiggle your toes for me.

440
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,468
Can you do that?

441
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:19,505
[Groaning]

442
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:23,293
Roy, wiggle your toes, okay?

443
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:25,928
Roy, wiggle your toes.

444
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,377
[Sighs]

445
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:33,205
- Jo: Unbelievable.
- [Cheers and applause]

446
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,836
All right, get him sedated
and get him up to recovery.

447
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:38,240
And good work, everybody. Thank you all.

448
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:41,283
She keeps saying talk to my
wife. Do you know what she means?

449
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:42,975
- I might.
- Well?

450
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:46,283
But I'm not talking about anything

451
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:50,112
I might have learned
in A.A. about someone...

452
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:52,398
Because I made a pledge there.

453
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:56,838
But someone else might know
what I can't talk about.

454
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:57,947
Is Pierce in A.A.?

455
00:17:57,972 --> 00:18:01,584
No. No! So you should
definitely talk to her.

456
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:04,421
- She'll just say talk to my wife.
- Then you should talk to your wife.

457
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:05,976
[Sighs]

458
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,823
- Meredith: Edwards, you ready?
- Uh-huh.

459
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:09,259
[Sighs]

460
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,667
It's invading everything.

461
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:12,994
I'm literally peeling it off the spleen.

462
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:15,653
And it's 7.8 pounds. Wow.

463
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,459
7.8 pounds of lousy parenting.

464
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,581
But she does have a Dutch braid.

465
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:22,741
It's like a French one,
but only harder to do.

466
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:24,957
I used to do it for my sister
when my mom was strung out.

467
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:26,384
Took me an hour, and it still fell apart.

468
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,244
Only a saint or her mother

469
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:30,381
would take the time to
do something like this.

470
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:33,714
You need an extra set of hands?

471
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:36,473
No, we're good. Thanks. Metz?

472
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,708
Alex: She takes the time
to do her daughter's hair.

473
00:18:38,906 --> 00:18:41,140
How the hell does she let
her develop an 8-pound tumor?

474
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:43,601
Well, you and I know
something about crazy mothers.

475
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:46,487
Be careful. It's impinging
on the left hepatic vein.

476
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:47,521
I see it.

477
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:49,280
[Heart monitor beeping rapidly]

478
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:50,380
Damn it.

479
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:58,506
Where are you? Where are you? Got it!

480
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:00,031
Meredith: She's bleeding
out from her liver.

481
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:01,585
I'm packing, but I can't control it.

482
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,977
- More laps. Hang another unit of blood?
- Right away.

483
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,680
Edwards, more suction. I said clamp, now!

484
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:08,415
Another. Another.

485
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:10,984
One bullet went through the right
lower quadrant and perfed the colon.

486
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,186
A penetrating injury to the liver here.

487
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,954
- I need more laps!
- She's crashing.

488
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:15,555
We got to stop this bleed. Suction.

489
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:16,623
Alex: Come on. Come on!

490
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,258
Meredith: Bulky 4-0 silk for ligation.

491
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,462
It's not working. We're gonna lose her.

[Heart monitor beeping rapidly]

493
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:25,632
What about a balloon tamponade?

494
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,200
- What?
- A balloon tamponade.

495
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:29,949
That could control a
penetrating liver injury.

496
00:19:29,974 --> 00:19:31,174
It should.

497
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:33,202
Yes. Get me a foley catheter.

498
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:35,029
- You might need more...
- More than one. I know.

499
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:37,196
Foley... now. Let's go.

You think that'll hold the bleed?

502
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:42,001
It's the best chance we've got.

503
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:43,898
Bulky clamp.

Nice work, Dr. Grey.

I don't know.

She's fine. You saved
her. She's... she's fine.

Your lap method... The
one you just published.

530
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:10,262
- The Grey method.
- The Grey method, yes.

531
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:13,699
Um, it's just been placed on
the short list of nominations

532
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:16,758
for the Harper Avery award.

533
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:19,649
Are y... it is? Are you kidding?

534
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:23,611
No surgical resident has
ever made that list before.

535
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:27,398
I only hope we can, uh,
convince you to stay in Seattle?

536
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:29,220
- Well, that's very...
- No, I know.

537
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:31,528
You'll have your veritable pick after this.

538
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,100
Um, very well done, Grey.

539
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:37,315
Oh, the board would
like to see you to, uh...

540
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,021
Of course.

541
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:50,997
- Meredith.
- Derek, not now.

542
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:52,770
Five minutes. Just five minutes.

543
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:54,010
[Sighs] Derek, I swear to God,

544
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:55,202
I can't do this right now.

545
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:57,296
I am sorry about the thing
I said about your mother.

546
00:21:57,334 --> 00:21:58,401
Why? You meant it.

547
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:00,403
It was in the heat of
the moment. I-I just...

548
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:01,918
You know, you wanted to
hurt me, and you did that,

549
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:04,133
so at least have the guts to stand by it.

550
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,373
Will you just hear me out?

551
00:22:05,398 --> 00:22:07,399
You could do worse than compare
me to a brilliant surgeon,

552
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:10,091
but you meant it in the sense
that I am cold and ambitious

553
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:12,430
and selfish, a horrible wife and mother.

554
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:13,522
I got that.

555
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:16,145
Well, I love how you just switch
it around so you can make it fit...

556
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,271
You think I sound like my mother? You do.

557
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:19,788
And now I get to live

558
00:22:19,823 --> 00:22:22,057
under the weight of
your disappointment, too?

559
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,825
Because of something you gave up.

560
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:25,803
If you recall, I gave it up for you.

561
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:28,259
Oh, you gave it up for
me, but I don't want it.

562
00:22:28,353 --> 00:22:31,340
Go. You should get on the next flight out.

563
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:33,666
Call the president and get the job back.

564
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:34,710
Just go.

565
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,535
[Sighs heavily]

566
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:25,322
Young Ellis: Blood.

567
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:26,822
It's just blood.

568
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:34,515
Meredith, don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid. [Gasps]

569
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,075
[Body thuds]

570
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:40,099
[Dial tone]

571
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:43,002
[Dialing]

572
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:45,304
[Ringing]

573
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:47,407
Operator: 911. What's your emergency?

574
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:49,333
My mother tried to kill herself.

575
00:23:58,285 --> 00:24:00,685
[Siren wailing]

576
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:39,056
[Indistinct talking]

577
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,110
You're a very resourceful little girl.

578
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:47,268
You know that?

579
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:49,694
You might have saved your mother's life.

580
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,945
Someone from child protective
services come here yet?

581
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,648
He's right there.

582
00:25:10,784 --> 00:25:12,151
You're still here.

583
00:25:12,185 --> 00:25:15,087
Yes. Uh, I was just worried
about the little girl.

584
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:16,221
Is she okay?

585
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:17,390
She's gonna be fine.

586
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:18,657
Thank God.

587
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:21,726
Child Protective Services
is here for her, so...

588
00:25:24,286 --> 00:25:25,653
Is that a Dutch braid?

589
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,870
When did she get sick... your daughter?

590
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,005
When did this start?

591
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:36,300
I just want to see her. Please...

592
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:38,843
No, you can't see her, but you can come
talk to Child Protective Services with me.

593
00:25:38,877 --> 00:25:39,944
No, I want to make sure she's okay.

594
00:25:39,978 --> 00:25:41,913
And they are going to call the police.

595
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:43,448
No. No, you can't do that.

596
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:46,384
You don't understand. We
have no papers, undocumented.

597
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,172
That's no excuse to abandon your kid.

598
00:25:49,197 --> 00:25:50,598
They will take her from me.

599
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,165
I've seen it to people I know.

600
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,694
They go to sleep in a surgical room,

601
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,612
they wake up in a plane
or in a different country.

602
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,305
It's called medical repatriation,

603
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,850
and it's not something that we do here.

604
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,959
I was afraid to even bring her here.

605
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:03,260
You think I didn't want to help her?

606
00:26:03,544 --> 00:26:04,979
What are my choices?

607
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:06,688
They do the surgery.

608
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:09,365
Then they send us back to
a country where we starve

609
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,660
or... or... or I will work as
a prostitute, or even worse,

610
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:15,882
they'll make her a prostitute,
and no one says anything about it.

611
00:26:16,394 --> 00:26:18,562
That is one choice.

612
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:22,443
The other choice is I ignore it and I pray

613
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:24,948
and I hope that she's okay

614
00:26:24,973 --> 00:26:28,069
[voice breaking] and I hope
that whatever my little girl has

615
00:26:28,094 --> 00:26:29,094
goes away.

616
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:31,626
And after a while, these choices...

617
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:32,851
they make you crazy.

618
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:38,069
And after a while, I-I say
to myself that she's fine.

619
00:26:38,094 --> 00:26:42,329
Then after a while, I...
I don't see the tumor

620
00:26:42,354 --> 00:26:43,860
when I look at her...

621
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:48,289
Because what is the alternative?

622
00:26:56,396 --> 00:26:57,862
[Knock on door]

623
00:26:57,887 --> 00:27:00,523
- Yep?
- So, uh, you're leaving.

624
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:02,191
For sure?

625
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:03,593
[Sighs]

626
00:27:03,627 --> 00:27:04,894
You should talk to your wife.

627
00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:07,342
Oh, no, that's, uh... that's not an option.

628
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,403
So, I'm asking you.

629
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,560
You know, i-it's not
really my place to say.

630
00:27:13,973 --> 00:27:16,610
And, honestly, I'm tired of saying it

631
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,269
'cause every time I do, it just gets worse.

632
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:21,962
What? What gets worse?
What are you talking about?

633
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,844
She's my sister.

634
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:30,583
My parents, my birth parents...

635
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,949
Are Ellis Grey and Richard Webber.

636
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,910
Your wife's my sister. So
you should talk to your wife.

637
00:27:38,935 --> 00:27:41,537
That's... so, Richard's your father.

638
00:27:41,562 --> 00:27:43,658
- Yes.
- And Meredith is your sister.

639
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,429
Half-sister.

640
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,277
I thought she would have told you.

641
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:49,003
Oh, no, no, we're not, um...

642
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:51,110
uh, Meredith is terrible with sisters,

643
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:52,849
just so you know, and, uh, I-I'm not.

644
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:55,276
I love sisters. I have a
bunch of them. And, um...

645
00:27:57,408 --> 00:27:59,214
I'm glad you told me. [Laughs]

646
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,606
It's nice to meet you.

647
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:02,546
[Laughs]

648
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,415
- It's nice to meet you.
- Oh!

649
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:14,557
This is very strange.

650
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:15,995
Yeah, I got to go.

651
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:18,874
Okay, don't leave...
okay?... Until we talk again.

652
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:22,330
Just... Don't leave.

653
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:30,237
[Keyboard clacking]

654
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,108
Okay, what is the deal with you and Pierce?

655
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:34,242
Bailey, please.

656
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:36,411
See, every time I bring her name up to you,

657
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:38,482
you look like I just
stabbed you in the chest.

658
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:40,875
Now, I think she's leaving because of you.

659
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:47,352
All right, you don't want
to tell me what happened,

660
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:51,906
you don't have to, but...
Did something happen?

661
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,320
She's my daughter...

662
00:29:00,926 --> 00:29:02,861
mine and Ellis Grey's.

663
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:04,973
[Gasps]

664
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:09,819
Oh, thank you, God.

665
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,931
- What?!
- Oh, no, no!

666
00:29:11,956 --> 00:29:13,950
I-I thought you had
had sex with that girl.

667
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:15,142
Bailey!

668
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,351
Wait. But that's why she's leaving?

669
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:20,216
She doesn't want anything to do with me.

670
00:29:20,997 --> 00:29:23,956
Well, then, she doesn't
know you, or she would stay.

671
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,369
Now, you have to go talk to her.

672
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,129
I think I'm too late.

673
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:30,925
No such thing.

674
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:35,047
I wish I could go back.

675
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:38,307
I'd do everything so differently.

676
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:42,226
We would've had a wonderful
life together, Ellis.

677
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:44,949
- You think so?
- I do.

678
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:47,579
We would've done our fellowship here,

679
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:49,636
and then you would've fought me for chief

680
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:51,696
- and probably won.
- [Laughs]

681
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:54,903
And... I wouldn't have minded

682
00:29:55,714 --> 00:29:58,003
because we'd have the kids at home.

683
00:29:58,325 --> 00:30:00,192
We have kids?

684
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:03,107
Meredith would've needed
a brother and sister.

685
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:06,671
Kids need family.

686
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,250
I would be fine, and we
could grow old together.

687
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,290
[Cries]

688
00:30:11,996 --> 00:30:14,053
My life is so unfinished.

689
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,346
It's unfinished, and I'm not finished.

690
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:20,054
No. No, Ellis.

691
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,214
[Cries]

692
00:30:22,248 --> 00:30:23,882
Don't think that.

693
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,624
Just close your eyes...

694
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:26,749
[Cries]

695
00:30:26,774 --> 00:30:29,575
And think of the family,

696
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:31,765
of the house...

697
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:35,359
And you there every night to come home to.

698
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:37,962
[Cries]

699
00:30:37,997 --> 00:30:40,131
And me there.

700
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:48,039
[Sighs]

701
00:30:48,074 --> 00:30:49,890
I lied to you before...

702
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:53,703
About what happened
that day at the carousel.

703
00:30:55,547 --> 00:30:57,204
I remember what she said.

704
00:30:58,181 --> 00:31:00,230
I remember what I said.

705
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:03,540
I remember everything.

706
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:11,580
[Sighs]

707
00:31:14,477 --> 00:31:17,579
It was a Thursday afternoon.

708
00:31:17,604 --> 00:31:19,772
We had made a pact...

709
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:24,103
She would leave Thatcher,
and I would leave Adele.

710
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:27,464
Your mother had just received

711
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:29,851
her first Harper Avery nomination.

712
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:31,477
She was so excited.

713
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:37,317
And I was... jealous.

714
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:40,076
Not like healthy competition.

715
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:44,622
A hateful, hopeless jealousy...

716
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:50,230
too far ahead to catch up to.

717
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,590
Her success illuminated everything

718
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:54,816
I hadn't yet accomplished.

719
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:02,405
The night before, as I worked
up the nerve to tell Adele,

720
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:05,547
I thought of your mother.

721
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:09,945
I thought of what she could
do at such a young age.

722
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:14,422
<i>I thought of what she would do.</i>

723
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:18,065
And I thought...

724
00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:22,272
"I will spend my life
feeling like this... "

725
00:32:25,247 --> 00:32:27,514
"My entire life."

726
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:32,955
So I ruined it.

727
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,848
[Sighs]

728
00:32:38,514 --> 00:32:39,747
Young Richard: You have a child.

729
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:42,162
Young Ellis: Don't say that.
I won't listen. Richard.

730
00:32:42,187 --> 00:32:43,392
I'm sorry. I can't.

731
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:45,587
No, please, please, please, please!

732
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:49,244
- Ellis, no.
- Richard, Richard, you can't leave me.

733
00:32:49,512 --> 00:32:51,180
Richard! Richard!

734
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:55,212
Richard!

735
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:06,373
[Crying]

736
00:33:11,805 --> 00:33:13,073
Are you okay?

737
00:33:17,153 --> 00:33:19,620
We have to go home. We have to go home.

738
00:33:20,202 --> 00:33:22,336
We have to go home.

739
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:25,967
And then she took me home.

740
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:27,346
Richard: Yes.

741
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:29,641
And then she attempted suicide.

742
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:33,699
[Sighs]

743
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:37,923
We would have had a whole other life.

744
00:33:40,474 --> 00:33:44,577
Everything after that was my fault.

745
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:49,341
I made the wrong choice
for the wrong reason.

746
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:53,914
And there's hardly a day
goes by that I don't...

747
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:04,327
I'm so sorry.

748
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,414
I bet you are.

749
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,030
Ellis: He's gone back to Adele.

750
00:34:13,055 --> 00:34:15,123
- Yes.
- Of course he has.

751
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:18,992
Mom...

752
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,891
He's afraid...

753
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,312
Afraid to be happy.

754
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:26,155
And I'm all alone.

755
00:34:28,086 --> 00:34:30,754
Now I have to raise my daughter alone.

756
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:34,256
[Voice breaking] How am
I expected to do that?

757
00:34:49,377 --> 00:34:50,922
Alex: She's pretty skittish.

758
00:34:50,947 --> 00:34:52,204
Ana, we need to talk to you.

759
00:34:52,229 --> 00:34:55,030
No. No, you said we will be all right.

760
00:34:55,055 --> 00:34:56,789
- It's okay. You're safe. Calm down.
- You can't take her from me.

761
00:34:56,814 --> 00:34:58,180
- I'm going. I'm go...
- Nadia is safe.

762
00:34:58,205 --> 00:34:59,571
I spoke to CPS.

763
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:01,798
I told them the whole thing
was a huge misunderstanding

764
00:35:01,823 --> 00:35:03,162
and that I made a mistake.

765
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:05,188
These people are lawyers from the hospital,

766
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:06,748
and they are going to help you.

767
00:35:07,196 --> 00:35:09,630
Ana, they're gonna work with
you, explain your rights,

768
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:10,856
help with the payment plan.

769
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:12,715
No one's gonna deny
Nadia medical treatment,

770
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,097
and no one's gonna take her away,

771
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:15,898
but you have to bring her
here to me for her treatments.

772
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:16,923
Do you understand?

773
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:20,321
Okay, I'm going to bring them in now.

774
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:27,848
Hi.

775
00:35:27,873 --> 00:35:29,479
No, no, no, I didn't vote for you.

776
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:31,260
Oh, like a month ago, you were
all, "tell me if you need help.

777
00:35:31,285 --> 00:35:32,758
I will help you." So full of crap.

778
00:35:32,783 --> 00:35:33,953
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

779
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:35,212
If you didn't want to vote for me, fine,

780
00:35:35,237 --> 00:35:36,637
but then why lie to my face about it?

781
00:35:36,662 --> 00:35:39,067
Because I didn't think that you'd
take the attending job if you knew.

782
00:35:39,092 --> 00:35:40,392
Look, if you're trying to
be a mentor or whatever,

783
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:41,451
right now you're sucking.

784
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:42,625
No, I'm not your mentor!

785
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,598
I-I mean, I am if you need me to be,

786
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:46,022
<i>but I need you to not need me to be.</i>

787
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:47,381
That's why I didn't vote for you.

788
00:35:47,406 --> 00:35:50,012
Listen, I spent the day
observing a fetal shunt placement,

789
00:35:50,037 --> 00:35:52,590
trying to suck up to a woman
who I'm 100% positive hates me.

790
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:54,962
The only reason that I
could even try to do that

791
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,187
is because you handled

792
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:58,381
that little girl's case so beautifully.

793
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,625
I need to take a step
back from peds surgery

794
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,372
if I'm gonna make this fellowship work...

795
00:36:02,397 --> 00:36:05,565
And if I'm gonna keep my
marriage from falling apart.

796
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,359
And the only way that I
can even try to do that

797
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:10,103
is if... is if you're here,

798
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:12,229
doing everything that I can't do.

799
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,618
I don't need you to be
my fellow anymore, Alex.

800
00:36:14,643 --> 00:36:16,149
I need you to be me.

801
00:36:16,947 --> 00:36:20,049
You're the only one I can trust to do that.

802
00:36:21,883 --> 00:36:24,122
I should be making a lot more money.

803
00:36:24,887 --> 00:36:28,022
A lot. A lot.

804
00:36:31,403 --> 00:36:32,670
Derek: Ah, no, stop. Stop.

805
00:36:32,695 --> 00:36:34,361
We're not fighting. The fighting is over.

806
00:36:34,386 --> 00:36:35,472
I am calling a halt to it.

807
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:37,431
God, Derek, you don't just get to do that,

808
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:40,299
decide when we're moving,
decide when a fight is over.

809
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:41,957
What if I'm not done fighting?

810
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:43,616
Oh, it's... it's not over.
I can guarantee you that.

811
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:45,142
We'll probably fight
tomorrow and the next day,

812
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:46,511
and this is gonna last for a while,

813
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:49,805
but right now we're gonna have a truce.

814
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,231
- A truce?
- Yes.

815
00:36:51,622 --> 00:36:52,788
Why?

816
00:36:53,112 --> 00:36:55,280
You have a sister.

817
00:36:57,471 --> 00:36:59,787
You're losing her,
Meredith, and you shouldn't.

818
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,652
You have a sister and you don't
tell me? This can't happen.

819
00:37:03,677 --> 00:37:05,907
When stuff like this comes
up, you have to let me know.

820
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:09,170
I... we put all our other
stuff aside, and it's like I...

821
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:11,332
I need to know that you're okay.

822
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,261
Are you?

823
00:37:13,286 --> 00:37:15,220
Are you okay?

[Sighs]

829
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:34,126
I remember moving to Boston.

830
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:36,199
I remember the two of us

831
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:38,312
basically hiding out in an apartment.

832
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:42,636
And I remember she cried a lot.

833
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:45,534
And I remember her belly getting big.

834
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:49,332
And I knew I wasn't
supposed to make any noise.

835
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:54,978
And then her water broke
on the kitchen floor,

836
00:37:55,003 --> 00:37:57,535
and that scared me because it reminded me

837
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,856
of the blood in the kitchen
when she cut her wrists.

838
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:02,556
And I went to the hospital.

839
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,548
- I was there...
- [Baby crying]

840
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,846
Both times.

841
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:09,192
And I heard a baby cry,
and I heard my mother cry.

842
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:11,818
And then we went home.

843
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,422
And her belly wasn't big anymore.

844
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:18,822
And then we moved across town
to a house, a really nice house.

845
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:22,389
And then she started her
fellowship at Mass Gen,

846
00:38:22,414 --> 00:38:25,516
and I just started first grade.

847
00:38:26,273 --> 00:38:29,908
And then she was just Dr. Ellis Grey

848
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,500
and I was just a kid in school

849
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:33,293
and everything went back to normal.

850
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:34,925
I mean, I was 5 years old.

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,585

00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:44,686

- Yeah.

You didn't ask for a sister,

880
00:40:29,403 --> 00:40:32,672
<i>they are our most valuable possessions.</i>

881
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:39,350
Ellis: Our lives are built on our mistakes

882
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,536
<i>as much as our successes.</i>

883
00:40:41,746 --> 00:40:43,314
She wrote mostly at night,

884
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:45,773
with a glass of wine,
as you can see by the...

885
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,067
Ring stains and...

886
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:52,529
but I think here is when she found out

887
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:56,201
she was pregnant because
the wine stains stop

888
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:59,196
and she starts writing
down everything she ate.

889
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:02,262
- So...
- This was when she...

890
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:04,719
Realized she was pregnant with you.

891
00:41:06,693 --> 00:41:08,831
So she wanted you to be okay.

892
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:11,596
She wanted to be healthy.

893
00:41:13,112 --> 00:41:15,657
She tried, at least.

894
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,082
<i>They made us who we are.</i>

895
00:41:21,558 --> 00:41:23,021
[Elevator bell dings]

896
00:41:29,551 --> 00:41:31,790
Ellis: The first time
I won the Harper Avery,

897
00:41:31,815 --> 00:41:35,250
I dedicated it to the men
who'd been so supportive.

898
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:37,043
[Laughter, applause]

899
00:41:37,201 --> 00:41:40,237
[Chuckles] No, I wish. Just kidding.

900
00:41:40,295 --> 00:41:42,719
The first time I won the Harper Avery,

901
00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:46,136
I thought, "screw all those boys."

902
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:47,191
[Light laughter]

903
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:49,820
I stood there, holding that trophy,

904
00:41:49,845 --> 00:41:53,480
and I thought about
everything I'd sacrificed,

905
00:41:53,903 --> 00:41:55,937
what I had overcome.

906
00:41:57,558 --> 00:42:00,209
And I dedicated that award

907
00:42:00,945 --> 00:42:04,863
to all the women surgeons
who would come after me.

908
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:06,021
[Applause]

909
00:42:06,046 --> 00:42:08,046
[Chuckles]

910
00:42:15,388 --> 00:42:17,023
Where were we?

911
