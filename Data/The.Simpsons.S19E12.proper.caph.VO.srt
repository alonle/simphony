00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:08,672
The Simpsons S19E12 (KABF05)
Love, Springfieldian Style

2
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,633
<i>L is for the way you look at me</i>

3
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:36,166
<i>O is for the only one I see</i>

4
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:42,560
<i>V is very, very extraordinary</i>

5
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,696
Sweet on you

6
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,067
Release the hounds

7
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:46,529
<i>E is even more than
anyone that you adore</i>

8
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,193
I can't wait to see my
Valentine's Day surprise.

9
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:53,026
Good, 'cause I'm parking
at it right now.

10
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:55,990
A carnival?

11
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,159
What's so romantic
about this?

12
00:00:58,157 --> 00:00:59,529
- Bye!
- See you later!

13
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:02,795
For the next two hours,
we'll be kid-free.

14
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,091
It'll be just like the time
we lost them at the mall.

15
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,671
That was the best
Christmas ever.

16
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,202
Ah, the Tunnel of Love.

17
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,681
Nothing gets a woman
in your arms faster

18
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:18,450
than scary robots
and simulated privacy.

19
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:34,670
Marge!
Look over there!

20
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,201
Mom and Dad are in there.

21
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,221
Want to ruin
their fun?

22
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:44,623
Bart, no, it's
Valentine's Day.

23
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:45,470
Okay...

24
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:47,001
but if Dad kisses
Mom too much,

25
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,711
a stork will lay an angel
egg in her tummy,

26
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:49,833
and the next thing you know,

27
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:51,831
we find a baby brother
in the cabbage patch!

28
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:53,021
Here's a thumbnail sketch:

29
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:56,332
In the first place, you...

30
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,682
Do whatever you want.

31
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:59,191
I'm getting a candy apple.

32
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:20,462
Due to a classic Jell-O prank,

33
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:22,222
this ride has been disabled.

34
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:26,231
Please remain in your boats.

35
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:27,871
You will be charged
for the extra time.

36
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:32,763
This is a terrible
Valentine's Day.

37
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:34,602
What if I told you
some of the greatest

38
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:36,593
love stories of all time?

39
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:39,743
"Romeo and Juliet"?

40
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:40,930
"Arthur and Guinevere"?

41
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:41,980
Brangelina?

42
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:46,190
Even better, a tale of...

43
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:47,122
One moment.

44
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:53,402
A tale of two young
outlaws in love.

45
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:56,443
<i>They were the Bonnie and Clyde
of their day.</i>

46
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:59,053
<i>Their names were
Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

47
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:00,253
Miss Bonnie,

48
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:02,913
might I escort you
to the picture show?

49
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:04,980
I swear I won't misbehave.

50
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,401
Then no, thank you.

51
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:07,922
This is Texas,

52
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:10,343
future home of
Akeem Olajuwon!

53
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:12,613
And I've got dreams
as big as he will be.

54
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:14,090
I want action!

55
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,311
Action, eh?

56
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,650
Clyde Barrow,

57
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:21,031
local bad boy.

58
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:22,253
Bonnie Parker.

59
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:24,262
Say, if you're so bad,

60
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:27,921
you could go stick up that
feed store over yonder.

61
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:29,472
Hmm.

62
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:30,821
Unless...

63
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:32,543
you're chicken.

64
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,452
No one calls me "chicken" without

65
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:36,802
goading me into
doing something stupid!

66
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,250
Ya idjit!

67
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,570
You could've had anything
you want for free!

68
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,433
You're a co-owner!

69
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:50,772
I'll see you at Thanksgiving!

70
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:55,690
Oats!

71
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:58,022
Texas caviar!

72
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:02,513
Good times.

73
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:07,193
Finally.
Some excitement.

74
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:10,523
<i>Wow, I guess violence
is her only turn-on.</i>

75
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:11,503
<i>Well, there might be others,</i>

76
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:13,233
<i>but I'm too lazy to
figure out what they are.</i>

77
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:14,611
<i>So violence it is!</i>

78
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:18,372
Oh, there's somethin'
this kissin' is missin'.

79
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:26,591
Oh, Clyde, you know
just what a girl likes.

80
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:32,431
Why are you shooting at us?

81
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:33,781
We cooperated fully!

82
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:34,952
It's a sex thing!

83
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:36,011
Say no more!

84
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:38,942
Hey, can I give you folks a lift?

85
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,621
Yes, to a series of banks,
up and down the state.

86
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,202
Banks?

87
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:44,050
Well, deposit yourselves in a seat

88
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,631
because you've earned my interest!

89
00:04:51,308 --> 00:04:52,471
Dateline: Texas.

90
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:55,981
<i>A nation, crippled by unemployment
and bored by Seabiscuit,</i>

91
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:58,751
<i>embraces two unlikely folk heroes.</i>

92
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:03,863
<i>Bonnie and Clyde souvenirs
are flying off the shelves,</i>

93
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:07,751
<i>and the Dust Bowl duo has
inspired their own radio show.</i>

94
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:10,302
Uh, Bonnie, where did you
put the money we stole?

95
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:11,641
I filed it under "G."

96
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:12,521
Under "G"?

97
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,101
Why would you
file it under "G"?

98
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,510
Because gee, it's swell
to have all that money.

99
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:17,201
I see.

100
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:21,842
Their notoriety has reached
the highest levels of government

101
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:24,693
To deal with the menace
of Bonnie and Clyde,

102
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:29,460
I am recalling all our air
defense forces from Pearl Harbor.

103
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:33,600
Somebody please remind
me to move them back.

104
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:37,051
I would be honored to perform that duty.

105
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:38,563
They're outlaws?!

106
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:40,812
I've been played
like a pair of spoons!

107
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,261
Well, who am I to judge?

108
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,243
It's the Depression, money's tight...

109
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:46,753
<i>Anyone who sees this
unmarried couple should...</i>

110
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:47,761
Unmarried?!

111
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,570
That's it.
I'm turning them in.

112
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:50,951
Hey, keep it down, will ya?

113
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:53,121
The part where all my men
get killed is coming up.

114
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:56,173
Listen, Sheriff, I can help
you take down Bonnie and Clyde.

115
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:58,932
After the racially
insensitive cartoon.

116
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:04,672
One taco coming up.

117
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:19,382
Even I'm offended by this,

118
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:21,542
and I'm a fat Southern sheriff.

119
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:25,082
Um...

120
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:26,683
the battery seems
to be dead.

121
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:29,391
I'll get some help by
hiding in that bush.

122
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:31,991
Come on, shoot! Shoot!

123
00:06:32,097 --> 00:06:33,993
Oh! Not me!

124
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,112
Bonnie, I love you.

125
00:06:38,117 --> 00:06:39,031
Will you marry me?

126
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:40,271
I don't know.

127
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,890
I guess I'm just looking
for a little more excitement.

128
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:46,180
Okay, but if you change your mind,
you know where I'm at.

129
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:48,780
Mm, I think we should see other people.

130
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,270
Say, Officer,

131
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:52,303
I like how you handle that gun.

132
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:52,990
Thanks.

133
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,190
I like the way
you take a bullet.

134
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:57,393
Hey, back off!
She's my girl!

135
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:59,302
Damn, just my luck!

136
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:03,591
Cool. Now we're shooting the birds

137
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,283
that are pecking at the bodies.

138
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:14,201
So that's the end
of the story, huh?

139
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:15,183
You'd think so, but...

140
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,543
We want to hear a story.

141
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:23,480
A story suitable for children.

142
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:24,190
All right.

143
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:27,940
This is a story of two
dogs with a love so strong,

144
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:30,139
no hose could separate them.

145
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:32,649
I call it Shady and the Vamp.

146
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,595
She's so beautiful.

147
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,752
Imagine what she looks
like with her collar off.

148
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,913
A mutt like you could never
get a fancy dame like that.

149
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:53,240
Even her fleas have more class than you.

150
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:59,660
Lady Bitington, will you be summering
in the hindquarters again this year?

151
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,821
Oh, no!

152
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,953
Chompy and I have taken
a cottage in West Leg.

153
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:06,721
It's where all the fleas are fleeing.

154
00:08:08,546 --> 00:08:10,801
Watch and learn.

155
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,481
You know, heaven must have
left its doggie door open

156
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:22,760
because you are one...

157
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:30,923
Oh, you poor thing!

158
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,120
Is there anything I can do?

159
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:38,521
You can have dinner with me.

160
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:39,900
All right.

161
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:41,652
But keep your nose
where I can see it.

162
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:43,071
Can you bring
a friend for me?

163
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:45,203
I like those chicks
with them head cones

164
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:48,022
when they start talking, you
can drop below the horizon.

165
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:00,730
Oh, Shady, you on a date, huh?

166
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:02,071
How's it-a goin'?

167
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:05,362
You say it's goin' kinda-a rough?

168
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:07,551
That is precisely
what I'm saying.

169
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:08,841
Sit down. Sit down.

170
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,250
I bring-a you a
nice-a bowl of Chianti.

171
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:27,411
Let go! Let go!

172
00:09:27,415 --> 00:09:30,142
No. You let go of the spaghetti!

173
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:38,413
You're pretty feisty
for an upper-class bitch.

174
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:43,042
Oh, I like that you use the
technical termfor a female dog.

175
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:44,081
Run, run!

176
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:47,161
The health inspector man,
he's-a here!

177
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:51,521
Why didn't I listen to Mama?

178
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:54,133
"Serve-a food to humans!"

179
00:09:57,578 --> 00:10:00,783
I have to admit,
that was exciting.

180
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:03,021
And I am in heat.

181
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:04,412
That's the safe time, right?

182
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,090
Oh, the safest.

183
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:17,763
That was the most...

184
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:20,851
wonderful night of my life.

185
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:22,390
That's odd.

186
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:24,021
I'm never sickin
the morning.

187
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:25,161
What could it be?

188
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:25,973
Oh, uh...

189
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:27,832
Is that a foxhunt I hear?

190
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:35,232
Shady!

191
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,272
I haven't seen Shady in weeks.

192
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:45,613
Any minute now

193
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:49,592
He'll scamper through
that doggie door

194
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,272
Any minute now

195
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:55,251
I'll be the dog
she's lookin' for

196
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:57,243
Any minute now

197
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:00,823
You'll be stuck
with her brood

198
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,720
Any minute now

199
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:07,540
This pooch will know she's screwed

200
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:12,453
My heart tells
me to trust him

201
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:16,693
But your head knows
he's a hound

202
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,760
I want to do the right thing

203
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:23,701
Come on, with all this
high-class tail around?

204
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:26,441
Any minute now

205
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:30,391
Our girl will make
a brand-new start

206
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:31,930
Yesss!

207
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:34,121
Any minute now

208
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:38,531
I won't care that
he broke my heart

209
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:45,340
Any minute now.

210
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,472
- Where's our dad?
- We need Daddy!

211
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:53,203
- I want to go find Daddy!
- Where's Daddy?!

212
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:55,623
I don't wanna hear another
word about your father.

213
00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:10,130
We gotta find our daddy.

214
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:12,281
Yeah, he's gotta teach
me how to lick my...

215
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,960
Oh, I figured it out.

216
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,810
You go ahead.

217
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:15,921
Come on!

218
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,733
- Oh, Shady!
- Oh, Shady!

219
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,480
- Shady!
- Shady!

220
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,350
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

221
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:23,853
- We need you, Daddy!
- Daddy!

222
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,402
Ah, got ya!

223
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:30,220
You strays are going
straight to the pound

224
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:32,961
where you're put to sleep...

225
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:35,530
by my boring stories.

226
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:36,771
And then you'll be killed!

227
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:44,010
Ah, looks like that problem
solved it self.

228
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:47,180
Now, uh, how 'bout you and
me sniff each other's butts?

229
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm just kiddin'.

230
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:51,412
Unless you want to.

231
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:59,381
Well, Looks like it's just
you and me again tonight.

232
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:13,680
Gawrsh, you can't kill me.

233
00:13:13,685 --> 00:13:15,062
I'm half-human!

234
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,610
Look, I wear clothes!

235
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:17,870
I speak English!

236
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:20,021
I'm speaking it right now!

237
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,970
Sure you are.

238
00:13:29,805 --> 00:13:31,753
You two are next.

239
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,401
Here's your last meal.

240
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:34,822
It's Cycle 5,

241
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:38,732
specially formulated for
dogs with five minutes to live.

242
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:43,541
Don't bite the hand
that kills ye!

243
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:48,431
Yay, Dad!

244
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:50,401
I knew you'd
come save us!

245
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,211
You two are going home,

246
00:13:52,218 --> 00:13:53,913
and I'm coming with ya!

247
00:13:58,148 --> 00:13:59,971
This place is no picnic,

248
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:02,553
but it sure beats
working for Disney.

249
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:13,333
Look who we found!

250
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:14,773
Can I keep him?
Can we keep him?

251
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:16,461
Well, that depends.

252
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,171
Does he want to stay?

253
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:22,030
I want to stay, sit,
roll over and beg!

254
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:24,842
Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please...!

255
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:28,001
All right,
we can be a family.

256
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,881
All four of us.

257
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:32,743
Uh... you know,

258
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:35,140
there are nine other puppies.

259
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:49,102
Even love is boring when
you're stuck in a tunnel of it.

260
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:50,851
Well, I've got a
Valentine's Day story!

261
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,223
It's about musicians
from a simpler time.

262
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:57,083
The era of The Brady Bunch,
Donny and Marie and...

263
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:00,313
Smash the flag

264
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:02,200
Burn the queen

265
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:03,952
Kick the sky

266
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,231
Antichrist!

267
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:11,543
Nancy, what are the odds?

268
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:14,153
You sign up for a
semester at U. of London;

269
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:16,451
then I immediately
do the same.

270
00:15:16,455 --> 00:15:18,633
Yeah, I'm really lucky
you saved me

271
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:21,940
from meeting other people
and having new experiences.

272
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:27,052
What is that raw,
primo sound?

273
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:28,573
You can't go in there.

274
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:30,462
Our guide book
says not to!

275
00:15:32,217 --> 00:15:33,790
<i>Hitler and her majesty</i>

276
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:35,460
<i>Sittin' in a tree</i>

277
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:38,960
<i>B-O-R-R-I-N-G!</i>

278
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:40,750
You rule, Sid Vicious!

279
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:42,142
You sicken me!

280
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:46,950
Why am I hittin' myself?

281
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:48,543
Why am I hittin' myself?

282
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:50,933
He's so uncompromising.

283
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:54,591
He'd never go for an uncool
spelling bee champion like me.

284
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,442
I've spelled "unrequited."

285
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:58,513
Now I know
what it means.

286
00:15:58,546 --> 00:16:00,991
Yo. I got Duds, Chunks, Twix,

287
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:03,081
Cadbury's, any way you want to go.

288
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,313
Chocolate?

289
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,390
Nancy's too smart to
put that in her body.

290
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:10,570
It's only for losers,
like musicians and...

291
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:11,781
Musicians?!

292
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,332
That's my girlfriend.

293
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:16,900
Then I guess you'll be
paying for her chocolate.

294
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:18,723
Uh, okay.

295
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,423
Gotcha!

296
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,313
That's nice work,
Officer Otto.

297
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,413
Happy to be of service,
old bean.

298
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:25,340
<i>...cannon, neat, neat, neat</i>

299
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:27,923
<i>She can't afford a gun at all
Neat, neat, neat.</i>

300
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:33,413
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

301
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:34,063
<i>Night!</i>

302
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:37,141
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

303
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:37,773
<i>Night!</i>

304
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:40,652
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

305
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:41,252
<i>Night!</i>

306
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:51,241
Look, an American
nerd bird.

307
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:52,283
Nerd bird?

308
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,421
Would a nerd bird
have chocolate, huh?

309
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:55,791
Would a nerd bird?

310
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,320
Stop saying "nerd bird!"

311
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:58,813
Chocolate is boring.

312
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,542
Maybe I'll have a piece.

313
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:03,903
You know, just to see
how boring it is.

314
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:10,021
Oh, you're offering
me some?

315
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:11,902
Um... I guess I could.

316
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,051
I mean, I do it all the time!

317
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,381
- Oh!
- Oh!

318
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:23,060
Yup, it's boring all right.

319
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,293
How much more you got?

320
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:25,212
Lots.

321
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:27,723
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone?</i>

322
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:30,472
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

323
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:32,970
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

324
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:35,023
<i>You shouldn't've
fallen in love with?</i>

325
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,731
<i>I can't see much of a future</i>

326
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:41,633
<i>Unless we find out
what's to blame</i>

327
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:43,192
<i>What a shame</i>

328
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:49,592
<i>And we won't be
together much longer</i>

329
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:53,850
<i>Unless we realize
that we are the same</i>

330
00:17:57,697 --> 00:17:59,871
<i>Ever fallen in love
with someone</i>

331
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,543
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

332
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:05,293
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

333
00:18:05,298 --> 00:18:08,102
<i>You shouldn't've fallen
in love with?</i>

334
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:15,332
We're gonna go out
and play our songs

335
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:18,263
like we've never played them
before: competently!

336
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:20,420
Where's Sid?

337
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:24,200
Sidney Sheldon Vicious!

338
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:26,751
Where you been,
chompin' Wonka?

339
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:32,303
When I hired a guy
named Sid Vicious,

340
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:35,573
I assumed it would be a 30-year
business relationship.

341
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:38,720
I told you to hire
Tom Responsible.

342
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:40,043
Slag off.

343
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:43,642
Here they are, all the way
from outside of Texas:

344
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:45,652
the Sex Pistols.

345
00:18:48,657 --> 00:18:50,523
<i>Education's bollocks!</i>

346
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,903
<i>Bollocks!
America is bollocks!</i>

347
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:56,872
<i>Bollocks!
Politeness is bollocks!</i>

348
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:59,400
<i>Bollocks!
Bollocks!</i>

349
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,153
Can't reach me bass.

350
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:03,920
Me back is front ward!

351
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:13,892
Dang it, I wanted to hear
what else was bollocks!

352
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:20,600
You gobbed up our gig,
you git!

353
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:25,510
You leave Sid alone!
He doesn't need you!

354
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:27,420
He's quitting the band!

355
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:28,812
I'm doing what now?

356
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:30,071
You're quitting the band.

357
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:32,692
He's going solo, and I'm
gonna write his songs!

358
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:33,540
Yeah!

359
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:35,723
Hey, you guys want to
be in my new band?

360
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:37,741
Ho!! Just stop talking

361
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:40,071
and bang your head
against the wall!

362
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,781
I'm doing this
'cause I want to,

363
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:44,301
not 'cause she told me to.

364
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:45,673
Bang harder!

365
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:46,301
Yes, pet.

366
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:53,353
<i>'Cause love is the elixir</i>

367
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:56,000
<i>The potion of emotion</i>

368
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:58,543
<i>The world-saving fixer</i>

369
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:01,382
<i>The lotion of devotion.</i>

370
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,831
This song doesn't make
me feel angry at all.

371
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:06,643
If anything, it makes
my anger ebb!

372
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:11,310
Your music violates everything
punk stands for,

373
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:12,302
which is nothing!

374
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:14,340
You are no longer
welcome at CBGB's...

375
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:16,300
Comic Book Guy's Bar

376
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:17,971
Oh, forget those jerks.

377
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:20,970
Let's go back to the hotel
and get Snicker-faced.

378
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:24,193
Oh, I love you,
my Hershey hero.

379
00:20:24,196 --> 00:20:26,683
And I love you,
Tootsie Roll.

380
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,291
Happy Valentine's Day

381
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:41,260
and shut your gob.
