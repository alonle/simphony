00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:13,962
ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to Super Bowl XLVIII

2
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:19,534
between the Seattle Seahawks
and the Denver Broncos.

3
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:22,303
The field is a frozen tundra,
(Bart laughing)

4
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:24,005
imported at great expense
from Alaska.

5
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,473
Hmm?

6
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:26,508
Hmm?!

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,575
Huh...?

8
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:30,045
(shrieks)

9
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:31,546
(gasps)

10
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:32,981
Oh!

11
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:34,115

12
00:00:35,985 --> 00:00:37,052

13

(screams, jabbers)

15
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:48,663
Whoo-hoo.

16
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:50,198
(whimpers)

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,033
(sobs)

18
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,135
(Homer continues
whimpering, sobbing)

19
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:57,072
(electricity buzzes,
Homer screams and whimpers)

20
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:02,710
(Homer screams,
electricity crackles)

21
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:05,013
ANNOUNCER: And the game
comes down to this one play--

22
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:06,714
(Homer screaming)
a final field goal.

23
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:08,583
The kick is up,
it hits the crossbar and--

24
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:09,584
(power humming off)

25
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:10,885
HOMER:
D'oh!

26
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,287
(Homer slurps beer,
then whoops)

27
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:31,706
(to tune of "Silver Bells"):
d Glowing rods, glowing rods

28
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:34,375
d It's making me

29
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:37,112
d Weak and dizzy...

30
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:38,780
Uh, rumor has it
they're about to give out

31
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:40,081
the company Christmas gifts.

32
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,050
Who told you that?

33
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:43,051
I got an in.

34
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:43,952
The VP of Personnel

35
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:46,054
is doing my girlfriend.

36
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:48,623
Ooh, look at you,
Mr. Connected.

37
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,092
I hope it's better than
last year's lousy gift.

38
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:52,560
CARL:
Yeah, what a rip.

39
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:54,095
Ugh. Remember this gift?

40
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:55,930
The executive stress ball.

41
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,266
BURNS' VOICE: One more squeeze
and you're fired.

42
00:01:58,268 --> 00:02:00,401
(gasps) Now I feel
more stressed than ever.

43
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:01,903
Gah! (gags)

44
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:03,738
BURNS' VOICE (muffled):
Excellent.

45
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,907
Excellent. Excellent.

46
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,243
Uh, you don't look
so excellent to me.

47
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:09,344
(retches)

48
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:12,914
Ho, ho, humbug.

49
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,416
Santa Claus approaches
to judge and punish.

50
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:22,090
Wow! A good gift
for once.

51
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:23,791
Oogle Goggles.

52
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:25,994
Augmented reality glasses.

53
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:28,463
You wear them like eyeglasses,
but inside the lens,

54
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:30,965
you see information about the
people and places around you.

55
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:34,936
Ooh, finally I'm not a slave
to my stupid human eyeballs.

56
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:36,838
(gasping in wonder)

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,306
HOMER:
Ooh!

58
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,941
Whoa.

59
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,676
(high-pitched gibbering)

60
00:02:43,612 --> 00:02:45,113
(smug chuckling)

61
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:46,347
Glasses, call Lenny.

62
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:47,949
Ooh, I'm getting a call.

63
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:48,950
Answer call.

64
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:49,984
Hello?

65
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:52,587
Lenny, it's me, Homer.

66
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,325
Hm. I always thought
it was "Simp-sen."

67
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:59,961
Really? Don't you ever
look up at the sky?

68
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:02,197
(theme song playing)

69
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:06,701
Always wondered
what that was.

70
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,037
Sir, I'm concerned about

71
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,305
your sudden generosity.

72
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:12,040
The doctor said
to bring you in right away

73
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:13,541
if you display
kindness or warmth.

74
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:14,842
Oh, don't worry.

75
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:17,212
This Santa still has claws.

76
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:20,982
As of now, each of
those nuclear nitwits

77
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,350
is wearing a
video camera.

78
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:25,019
With a direct feed to me.

79
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:26,487
(gasps) You're
spying on them?

80
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,823
Smithers, how much
did this company lose

81
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:30,892
to office supply
theft last year?

82
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:32,994
$7,043.

83
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:35,029
Yes, well, no more of that.

84
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,699
Thanks to this $26 million
surveillance system.

85
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:38,833
Beware, rabbits.

86
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:41,569
I spy with my transplanted eyes.

87
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:44,239
Oh, and I forgot
to show you the best feature.

88
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:48,076
Each of these buttons
represents an employee.

89
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:51,279
When I press it,
he or she dies.

90
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:57,018
(scoffs) What's wrong
with this thing?

91
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,486
(grunts in frustration)

92
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,376
Now, remember kids,

93
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:23,911
the school says you must
have a valentine card

94
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:26,080
for everyone in your class.

95
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:29,584
How does this mean anything
when everyone's forced to do it?

96
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:31,386
What did I say
about pointing out

97
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:33,921
the meaninglessness
of things?

98
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:35,456
Not to.

99
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,058
Well, no way I'm giving
a valentine to Nelson.

100
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,260
He's a bully,
and I do not love him.

101
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:41,396
Jesus says
to love your enemies.

102
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:43,731
That's because
Jesus knows one day,

103
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,634
he gets to look
his enemies in the eye and say

104
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:50,104
"It was me who
sent you to Hell."

105
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:51,773
Bart, your school
requires you

106
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,975
to give everyone
a valentine card

107
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:56,911
in an envelope
with a fun sticker.

108
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:59,080
Your teacher
put out an e-mail alert.

109
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:01,983
With a video attachment.

110
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:05,253
<i>MAN:

<i>Danny is unpopular,</i>

115
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,432
<i>due to rumors he sleeps in the
raw with his ma and his pa.</i>

116
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:21,102
<i>Human young are born with the
ability to count valentines,</i>

117
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:23,938
<i>and Danny realizes
he's been snubbed.</i>

118
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,175
Past generations of children
were used to rejection.

119
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:30,611
But today's kids, raised
in a climate of video games

120
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:33,448
and instant messaging,
are fragile weirdos.

121
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,783
<i>LYMAN:

gets a valentine.

130
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,574
An old one from the box.

131
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:04,145
Perfect. Bad movie, bad pun,

132
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:06,247
even bad paper stock.

What's so funny?

136
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:15,022
I'm watching videos of idiots
wearing these glasses

137
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:18,159
and not paying attention
to the world around them.

138
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:19,494
Look at these jerks.

139
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:21,295

140
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,734

state of the art,
solar-powered,
computo-glasses.

00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,016
I'll let you try them on,

145
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:43,684
right after I decide
if these videos

146
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:45,052
are Funny Or Die.

147
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:48,523
Funny, funny, die, die,

00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,391
funny, funny but
the guy died.

149
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:52,093
Oh.

150
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:55,196
Now, a simple Sunday drive
will reveal the hidden wonders

151
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:57,098
of our hometown.

152
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:01,402

D'oh!

00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,383
Springfield City Hall was built

<i>Meet Me At City Hall.</i>

158
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:21,756
It was just a flat wall with
nothing behind it for 30 years.

159
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:24,459
Dad, Bart's on my side
of the seat.

(both grunting)

162
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:31,065
The rearview mirror
was invented in 1911,

163
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,266
for just this reason.

164
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:33,734
Interesting.

165
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:35,403
When was the term
"shut up" invented?

166
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:38,306
As early as 1859,
shut up was used to shut up...

167
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:40,975
Homie, I think the kids
are just hungry.

168

you're so wonderful.

182
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:24,952
Huh? A-Are you using your
glasses for snuggling?

183
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:27,822
But the avatar
looks just like you.

184
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:29,690
I'm afraid wives
don't make passes

185
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:32,193
at husbands in
those glasses.

186
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:35,963
Glasses, find me
a great gift for my wife.

187
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,498
(whispers):
Under five dollars.

188
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
MARGE:
I heard that!

189
00:08:39,002 --> 00:08:41,235
Glasses, take me
two minutes back in time.

190
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,810
Oh... (grumbles)

191
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:51,979
Marge.
Mm.

192
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,048
About the glasses.
Mm!

193
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,551
I'm really
sorry, and...
Mm, mm, mm.

194
00:08:56,553 --> 00:08:58,653
Here's your breakfast.

195
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:01,155
Only five pancakes?

196
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:02,523
You're trying to kill me.

197
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,525
Well, I'm not happy with you.

198
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,494
Look, honey,
I know these glasses

199
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:08,496
are a radical
new technology

200
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:10,498
and should be worn
in moderation.

201
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,866
Isn't that right,
glasses?

202
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:13,868
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Yes, just like I told you.

203
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,370
Anyway, I'm giving them up.

204
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:19,407
To whoever dares take them.

205
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:25,913
(Lisa and Bart gasp)

206
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:27,915
Yoink.

207
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,684
Aw, come on, Mom.

208
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:32,019
For once,
I'm grabbing the goody.

209
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:33,921
So the rumors are true.

210
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:36,424
<i>Moms can want things.</i>

211
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:40,094
Hmm.

212
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,434
Hmm...

213
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:48,035
Nicely done, Lewis.

214
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:52,540
A Transformer
that transforms into a heart?

215
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,774
I love it!

216
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:00,381
Mm. This Hershey's Kiss
is melted.

217
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:02,550
Not good.

218
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:05,052
My mom left it
on the dashboard!

219
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:06,621
My mom...!

220
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:08,956
I'll have yours now, Simpson.

221
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:12,593
In Ga'hoole,

222
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:14,528
we would break
his frickin' knees.

223
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:17,098
No.

224
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,166
No Valentine
for you, Nelson.

225
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:22,637
Excuse me?

226
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,305
I'll give a Valentine
to a loser,

227
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:25,940
I'll give a Valentine to a dork,

228
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:27,908
I'll even give a Valentine
to a girl,

229
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,312
but I won't give a Valentine
to a bully!

230
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:33,914
Here's what's gonna happen.

231
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:38,085
You have one week to make me the
best Valentine any kid ever got.

232
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:39,587
And what if I don't?

233
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:42,256
Simpson, there's gonna be
a heart in my hand,

234
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:44,859
either paper or yours.

235
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:48,963
Hey, everybody.
That's strange.

236
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:52,633
I-I'm hearing a voice,
but I'm not seeing a user icon.

237
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:55,102
Carl, it's me.
I'm here.

238
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:56,437
Really here!

239
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,606
Hey, Homer. A lot
of information about you.

240
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:02,009
Let me just
page through it.
Oh! Stop! Hey! What?

241
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:05,112
Oh, no one can live
in a non-augmented reality.

242
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:07,415
I need another pair of glasses.

243
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,951
Charlie, your move
in Muppet Chess.

244
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:12,953
Gonzo to Fozzie Seven.

245
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:16,023
Aw! That's Kermit-mate.
Wocka wocka!

246
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:17,958
Oh, why is it

247
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
the recipe card
you need is always

248
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:22,229
the one Homer writes
his cocktail ideas on?

249
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:26,300
Maybe these
bleep-bloop glasses can help.

250
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:29,870
Okay, Marge Simpson
entering the Matrix,

251
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:32,640
for a brownie recipe.

252
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:35,142
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Here are my top-rated recipes.

253
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:38,979
Ooh. So many choices, Maggie.

254
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:41,415
(beeping)

255
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:47,888
HOMER:
Um, Mr. Burns, sir?

256
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,890
Can I get another pair
of glasses?

257
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:52,493
Maybe two pair?
One for the beach house?

258
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,495
Can I also get a beach house?

259
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:56,397
<i>Two beach houses.</i>

260
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,331
Huh?

261
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,332
Monitors?!

262
00:11:58,334 --> 00:11:59,667
What the...?

263
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:04,371
Burns gave us those glasses
so he could spy on us!

264
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:07,374
This is a violation
of our human rights.

265
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:08,342
(cracks knuckles)
Okay,

266
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:10,745
so let's see
what we can see.

267
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:12,847
Solitaire, top hats on eBay,

268
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:14,882
Angry Birds fan fiction,

269
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,184
guy doing really easy
crossword puzzle,

270
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,886
Lenny doing
Carl's clown makeup...

271
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:21,021
someone's actually working?

272
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:22,923
Maggie?!

273
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,892
Who's Mommy's little girl?

274
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,528
<i>Genealogy.org says you are!</i>

275
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,929
You are!

276
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,397
(Maggie giggles)

277
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,399
(chuckles):
Aw...

278
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:35,202
Wait a minute. Since Marge
is wearing my glasses,

279
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:37,538
I can see everything she sees!

280
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,540
Uh-uh, I shouldn't watch this.

281
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,242
MARGE:
Such a good baby.

282
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:43,244
You deserve some ice cream.

283
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:46,714
Wait a minute-- Marge said
we were out of ice cream.

284
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:49,049
(Marge humming happily)

285
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,050
Ooh!

286
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:52,386
(Marge chuckles)

287
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:54,255
(gasps) Oh!

288
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:56,957
What else
is Marge hiding from me?

289
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,127
(doorbell rings)
MARGE:
Maggie, he's here!

290
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,797
Oh, is she having an affair?

291
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,066
Thanks for asking me to lunch.

292
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:09,136
Oh, why isn't she
having an affair?!

293
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:14,575
What about a Valentine
that says: "Bully, for you"?

294
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:17,077
Hmm, interesting.

295
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:18,579
"Interesting" means "no."

296
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:20,447
"Interesting" means "no."

297
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:21,949
(snaps fingers)

298
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,751
Milhouse, you're a genius!

299
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:25,920
I am? What did I say?

300
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:28,122
(groans):
Oh, nothing.

301
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:30,090
On TV when a guy
says something lame,

302
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:33,093
another guy says he's a genius,
and then he has an idea.

303
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:34,929
I thought it might
work for me.

304
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:37,131
Well, you called me a genius.

305
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,666
That means a lot.

306
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:40,968
Oh, I hate this
stupid holiday!

307
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,804
The only thing you
can do is screw it up.

308
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,306
(gasps)
That's it!

309
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:47,775
Bart, you're a genius!

310
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:51,178
Well, if you keep throwing the
word around, it means nothing.

311
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,783
Who are you?
Mr. Burns!

312
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:57,618
Oh. I'm so sorry,
Mr. Burns.

313
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,854
I won't bother
you again.

314
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:08,195
<i>HOMER: Marge, that's
a "Compact Only" space.</i>

315
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,698
(Marge grunts)

316
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,968
<i>(chuckles): Well...
who knew you were such a rebel?</i>

317
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,504
Now let's learn more
about my wife's secret life.

318
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:21,141
Secrets which can only be good.

319
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:22,977
Hi, Marge.

320
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:24,979
Dr. Carlock is ready for you.

321
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:26,881
Thank you.

322
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:30,017
So, Marge, how have you been?

323
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,986
(sighs):
Okay, I guess.

324
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:34,321
Marge is in therapy?!

325
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:36,190
MARGE:
Oh, I hate when I come here

326
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,826
and the first word
out of my mouth is "Homer."

327
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:40,828
But here we go, again.

328
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,565
(sighs) Homer was converting
our dollars to "yu-ros."

329
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:47,101
Not the money,
the sandwich.

330
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,074
And has there been any
improvement in Homer's drinking?

331
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:56,911
Well, he's down
to two beers in the shower.

332
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:58,879
They're pale ales! Please!

333
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:00,714
Well, maybe if
you just concentrate

334
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,549
on one problem, like his temper.

335
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:05,686
MARGE: Oh, everything
in the newspaper makes him mad.

336
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:08,389
<i>Not    Marmaduke!
Never Marmaduke!</i>

337
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:11,025
Marmaduke was
horrible today!

338
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:14,895
Also, Marge is in therapy,
and she didn't even tell me.

339
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:17,364
Whoa. She has
crossed a line.

340
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:19,366
How did you find out?

341
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:21,068
Spied on her
with a hidden camera.

342
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,037
She thinks I'm selfish.

343
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,539
She thinks I don't spend
enough time with the kids.

344
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,041
Well, that's crazy.
Come on.

345
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:29,610
You work your butt off in
a radioactive hellhole,

346
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:32,279
and what do you get?
Not one lousy superpower.

347
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:34,548
I guess the only choice
is to come clean with her

348
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,550
<i>and tell her what I know,
and    hI know.</i>

349
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:37,584
Whoa, whoa!

350
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:38,953
Bad idea. No, no.

351
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:42,122
Chicks do not like finding out
they're being spied on.

352
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:48,796
I speak from loooooong....

353
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:50,064
experience.

354
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:52,232
No, you got to make it seem like

355
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:54,068
you found out by accident there.

356
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,436
Um... ooh!

357
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:57,237
<i>Next week you schedule
an appointment</i>

358
00:15:57,239 --> 00:16:00,441
with the therapist after hers,
and then you bump into Midge

359
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:02,076
in the waiting
room there.

360
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:03,911
Moe, that's great!

361
00:16:03,913 --> 00:16:05,913
(chuckles):
How do you get your ideas?

362
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,015
Pretty much all my friends
are divorced guys.

363
00:16:09,484 --> 00:16:12,086
Hello, Homie!

364
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:13,087
Dinner's almost ready.

365
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:15,923
Pork chops with
my secret seasoning.

366
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:20,094
<i>Yeah, you do like your
secrets, don't you, Marge?</i>

367
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:22,129
Don't lose your
cool, Homer.

368
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:25,632
<i>The building block of a
marriage is long silence.</i>

369
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,301
Hey, where'd
she go?

370
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,303
Good, good,
you held your tongue there.

371
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:31,105
<i>Because-- hey, where'd you go?</i>

372
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:34,308
Doesn't anybody want me
to give 'em advice?

373
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,144
Okay there, Fido,
when you see that
squirrel outside,

374
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:39,947
at first you play it cool,
you understand?

375
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:41,181
(barks twice)

376
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:45,119
"I fear you"?

377
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:47,654
This is what Valentine's Day
means to you?!

378
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:49,490
This is what it means
to everyone.

379
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:52,126
How can you be forced
to say "I love you"?

380
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:54,795
People only give Valentines
because they're scared

381
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:57,031
of what would happen
if they didn't.

382
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:00,334
"Nelson, you frighten me so,

383
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:03,003
"The psycho-est bully I know,

384
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:06,373
"You're a sociopath
in need of a bath,

385
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,710
I'm sure you'll wind up
on death row."

386
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:12,312
(sniffing)

387
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:15,549
Mmm! You can really smell
the fear on this.

388
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:17,017
I rubbed it on Milhouse.

389
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,720
Simpson, you just
touched my heart's butt.

390
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,722
Why are you hugging yourself?

391
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,991
Why are you
hugging yourself?!

392
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:27,027
If Nelson doesn't do something
bully-ish in two seconds,

393
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:28,862
I'm gonna wedgie him.

394
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:31,031
Nelson doesn't
wear underwear.

395
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:33,801
Wow. Always
one step ahead.

396
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,372
Uh, I'm here to
check in for the 3:00.

397
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:41,175
Please fill out these
forms, Mr. Fakinami.

398
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:44,344
No, it's "Fake Name."
I'll just
call you Elias.

399
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:46,747
That's "Alias."

400
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:48,082
Duh. Hm!

401
00:17:56,357 --> 00:17:58,192
<i>HOMER:
Finally.</i>

402
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:01,228
<i>Time for the big bump-into.</i>

403
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,030
Same time
next week, Marge?

404
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,731
Oh, absolutely.

405
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,101
These sessions keep me
on an even keel.

406
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:10,904
Dr. Carlock is like
my Wednesday reset button.

407
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:12,539
<i>HOMER:
Wednesday?</i>

408
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,142
(pleasant classical music
playing)

409
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:27,387
d

410
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:32,059
<i>Okay, she's always
in a good mood after therapy.</i>

411
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:35,162
(sad, minor-key music playing)

412
00:18:43,738 --> 00:18:46,006
d

413
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:50,944
(Marge hums happily)

414
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:52,246
Oh, my God.

415
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:54,081
<i>Marge needs this.</i>

416
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:58,252
It lights her way through
the dark path of marriage to me.

417
00:18:58,254 --> 00:18:59,987
Come on in, Mr. Fakinami.

418
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:01,755
No need.
Everything's fine.

419
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:04,925
I'm sorry, but there
are no cancellations
within 24 hours.

420
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:07,594
(chuckles): Well, as long as
I'm paying for the time...

421
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:09,663
Ow! Where'd you learn
to cut hair?

422
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:10,931
(nervous chuckle)

423
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,432
You know, you have
some anger issues.

424
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,168
More snip, less lip.

425
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,304
Oh, I forgot to
tell you, Homie,

426
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:21,008
I bumped into Helen Lovejoy
today, and guess what?

427
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,342
I don't need
to know, Marge.

428
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:24,778
You deserve
to have your secrets.

429
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,780
It's not a secret.
It's a funny story.

430
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:28,982
Okay, Marge,
but first, well...

431
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:31,318
I have something
I need to tell you.

432
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,620
Something I did
you might be mad about,

433
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:34,988
and rightly so.

434
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,691
Oh, I bet my story's
more interesting.

435
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:39,126
Whoo-hoo! I tried!

436
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:40,294
Okay.
Okay,

437
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:42,296
so, Helen Lovejoy
told me that

438
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:45,332
she made her famous
snickerdoodle Bundt cake
for the church sale,

439
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:47,968
and she put in salt
instead of sugar!

440
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,170
(laughs)
Yeah? And...?

441
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:52,472
That's it.
That was the story.

442
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:54,875
Where's that cake now?
It got sold.

443
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,543
Who bought it?
Dr. Hibbert.

444
00:19:56,545 --> 00:20:00,047
Excuse me.
I have to make a call.
Don't take too long.

445
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:04,585
Okay, Hibbert's in surgery,
but they're having him paged.

446
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:07,321
(both moaning passionately)

447
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:08,655
Wait, something's wrong.

448
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:10,891
(grunts) That's better.

449
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:12,726
Oh, dear God.

450
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:20,334
Hi, Ralph. Um, I just
wanted to tell you,

451
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:23,370
there was a tooth
in the Valentine you gave me.

452
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:25,872
Plant it and you'll
grow a new Ralph.

453
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:29,042
I don't need a new Ralph.
I like the old one.

454
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,844
Happy Valentine's Day.

455
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:33,914
Well, better get ready
for St. Patrick's!
