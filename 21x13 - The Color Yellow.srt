3
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:57,136
I'll have to use me explosives.

4
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:59,739
Explosives? Great.

5
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:01,807
If we put charges on
the load-bearing walls,

6
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,142
we can blow up detention hall

7
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,611
while leaving the
art room unharmed.

8
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:07,013
Hmm? Hey, I like art, okay?

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,782
I'm blowing up the stump,
not the school.

10
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,751
Right, right.

11
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:13,319
You never saw that.

12
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:25,765
Well done, boy.

13
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:27,033
Wait, here comes the "mykeeyah."

14
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,467
What's a mykeeyah?

15
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:32,004
My Kia!

16
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:36,942
I'm laughing to fit in,
but I still don't get it.

17
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:40,546
Miss Hoover,
what's our lesson today?

18
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:42,415
Is it school?

19
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:47,987
Oh, I don't know. Let's see.

20
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,457
Family trees.

21
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:54,393
Who here knows what
a family tree is?

22
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:55,928
Oh, family trees--

23
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:58,597
the charts representing
genealogical relationships

24
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,566
in a branching structure.

25
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:01,967
Very good, Lisa.

26
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:03,736
Class, your assignment
over the weekend will be

27
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:05,671
to make your own family tree,

28
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:09,108
emphasizing any notable or
distinguished ancestors.

29
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:11,644
I can't wait to see
what noble branches lie

30
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:14,213
in the Simpson family foliage.

31
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:18,651
No, this can't be right.

32
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:21,220
Yech, they're all horrible.

33
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:24,690
Yeah, the Simpson family is a
long line of horse thieves,

34
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:28,561
deadbeats, horse beats,
dead thieves, and even a few...

35
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:30,896
...alcoholics.

36
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:32,898
There must have been
some good ancestors.

37
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,667
Grampa,

38
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:36,268
don't you know any? Not a one.

39
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:38,971
Maybe the nicest was
Abigail Simpson,

40
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,574
who you know as the
Pittsburgh Poisoner.

41
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:42,875
Listen, Lisa, you're going to find

42
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:44,343
more than you bargained for.

43
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:47,012
If I were you,
I wouldn't dig into the past.

44
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,816
I lived in some of that past,
and I got out for a reason.

45
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:52,952
I won't give up.
I have to know that somewhere

46
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,488
in the muck and the mire and
the Pittsburgh Poisoners,

47
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,223
this family had a noble spark,

48
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,493
and I will find it, even if I
have to go back to Adam and Eve.

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,827
Oh, you mean

50
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,262
Adam and Eve Simpson,

51
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,966
or as you may know them,
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

52
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:12,638
Ooh! Whoa!

53
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:18,844
Well, are you going
to help me or what?

54
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:34,894
Thank you.

55
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,096
So, what are you looking for?

56
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:39,832
Family records for a school
project on genealogical...

57
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,901
Hey, that's great.

58
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:57,983
Hey, Dad's idea pad.

59
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:00,719
<i>Bicentennial issue of
Reader's Digest.</i>

60
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,955
Old ad for Buzz Cola.

61
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,660
So dusty.

62
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:16,302
The "Diary of Eliza Simpson"?

63
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:19,371
This entry is dated April 14, 1860.

64
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,407
I warn you: I don't
know what's in there,

65
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:24,610
but if it's about a Simpson,
you ain't gonna be proud.

66
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:27,913
Our ancestors were
kicked out of Australia.

67
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:29,315
Oh, stop.

68
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:31,450
It's the journal of
a sweet little girl.

69
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:32,518
Keep reading, honey.

70
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:33,886
"Dearest diary,

71
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:36,088
today I am the happiest
girl in Springfield..."

72
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:37,923
See, all good.

73
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:40,859
"...because tomorrow I shall
get my very first slave."

74
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:46,013
I can't believe we're
descended from slave owners.

75
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:47,581
Me neither.

76
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:49,483
For once, the Simpsons
were in management.

77
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:50,718
Homer.

78
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:54,088
Oh, read a little more, honey.

79
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:57,057
"Saturday, April 14, 1860.

80
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,926
"Dear Diary, I must be brief,

81
00:04:58,993 --> 00:05:00,794
"for tonight is the grand ball

82
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:02,963
at Colonel Burns's plantation."

83
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:04,998
I shall dress myself in finery,

84
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:06,867
like a well-to-do Southern belle.

85
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:08,202
What's for dinner?

86
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:11,705
Possum. Oh, can't we have opossum?

87
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:13,240
Not on your salary.

88
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:16,944
I can't believe I buttoned
my britches for this.

89
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:19,747
In my elegant gown,
no one will suspect

90
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:21,749
that I'm actually
on a mission to help

91
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:24,151
my very first slave
escape to freedom.

92
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,787
Yes! She wasn't a slave owner.

93
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:30,023
Our family was on the
Underground Railroad.

94
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,493
We ran a subway station?

95
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,094
No, the Underground Railroad

96
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:36,597
was a bunch of people who
helped slaves escape to Canada.

97
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:39,099
There were no actual trains
and it wasn't under ground.

98
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,835
Then they should've called it
the Aboveground Normal-Road.

99
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:43,504
Good point, Bart. Absolutely.

100
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:45,005
Hadn't thought of that before.
Very good, Bart.

101
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:46,874
That's a great story, Lisa!

102
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:49,410
And you should stop
reading right there.

103
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,079
Wh-What are you doing?

104
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:53,680
I want to know what happens next.

105
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:54,982
Well, I don't.

106
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:56,817
The motto of the Simpsons is:

107
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:58,285
"Quit while you're ahead."

108
00:05:58,353 --> 00:05:59,753
I made it into a sampler.

109
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,590
It's like when your
father and I left

110
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:06,560
<i>the movie Carrie right after she
was crowned prom queen.</i>

111
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:08,595
She was so happy.

112
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:11,131
She had a lot of problems,
but they were all behind her.

113
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,466
But, but, but-but-but...

114
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:13,934
Time for bed, sweetie.

115
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:19,973
<i>Lisa. Lisa, it's me.</i>

116
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,142
<i>Eliza, the one good Simpson.</i>

117
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,745
<i>I've got so much more to tell you.</i>

118
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:30,884
I must know.

119
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:45,532
You still reading that thing?

120
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,535
I'm warning you: When
something goes into that vent,

121
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:50,137
it shouldn't come out...

122
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:52,105
ever.

123
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,107
<i>Well, I am reading it,
and when I'm finished,</i>

124
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:56,043
I'm going to use Eliza's diary

125
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,111
for my "Black History
Month" presentation.

126
00:06:58,179 --> 00:06:59,646
Ooh, good idea.

127
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:01,949
Bart, what are you doing
for Black History Month?

128
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:04,585
I got an idea:
You can march to Selma,

129
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:05,786
and tell her she's ugly!

130
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,192
Listen. "April 20, 1860.

131
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,195
"A week ago, I had no idea
what the future would bring,

132
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:17,798
"which, I guess, is always
true of everyone all the time.

133
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,566
"Anyway, last Saturday night,

134
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:21,068
I went to Colonel Burns's ball."

135
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:35,015
I don't like this new Viennese
dance craze, "the waltz."

136
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,683
One, two, three, one, two, three...

137
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:39,653
Where's the "four"?
All music needs a four!

138
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:42,556
I'll have the orchestra adjust
its time signature, sir.

139
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:44,291
See that you do.

140
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,059
* *

141
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,838
<i>In the confusion,
I slipped out of the ball</i>

142
00:07:57,906 --> 00:07:59,439
<i>and made my way to the stables,</i>

143
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:03,610
<i>where I was to meet Mr.
Burns's slave, Virgil.</i>

144
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:07,681
<i>But when I got to the stables,
he was nowhere to be seen.</i>

145
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:10,050
Virgil?

146
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:11,051
Virgil, let's go.

147
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,626
You look like you could
use a little help.

148
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:21,795
Actually, I'm here to help you.

149
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:24,565
Follow me north to freedom.
I don't think so.

150
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:26,600
Why? Because I'm young
and I'm a woman?

151
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:28,168
No, because you're pointing south.

152
00:08:29,804 --> 00:08:31,838
Oh, right, right. Sorry.

153
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:33,607
It's my first time.

154
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:36,176
That's all right. It's my 14th.

155
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:38,211
<i>As we made our way northward,</i>

156
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,113
<i>a couple of patrollers spotted us.</i>

157
00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:42,282
Well, well, well.

158
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,318
Where do you think you're going?

159
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:45,652
Run!

160
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,321
After them! Obviously.

161
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:49,356
Well, you didn't say it.

162
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,993
<i>Hearts pounding,
we fled into the woods,</i>

163
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:54,595
<i>but their horses were fast.</i>

164
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:12,346
<i>Escape seemed impossible.</i>

165
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,050
<i>What happened next?</i>

166
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:19,853
Uh, bu... That's all theres.

167
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:21,922
The rest of the diary
has turned to dust.

168
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:29,763
Oh! I'll never know if Eliza
got Virgil safely to freedom.

169
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:31,598
Cheer up, sweetie.

170
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,101
Maybe we can find the
answer in the library.

171
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:35,836
To the reference desk!

172
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:38,939
The library?

173
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:41,441
Bart, can you believe we're
married to those nerds?

174
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:44,745
<i>There are no books</i>

175
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:47,848
about an Eliza Simpson,
but I did find this.

176
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:49,249
Ooh, a cookbook.

177
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:52,786
That's Eliza's mother!

178
00:09:52,854 --> 00:09:54,755
Martha, you are the best!

179
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:59,459
"Pork Butt in Cream,
" "Snout-Fried Neck,"

180
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:02,095
"Frog-Haunch," "Hooves Au Jus,"

181
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:03,897
"Possum Pouch Pie..."

182
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:06,400
Please don't make those recipes.

183
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,201
This one doesn't sound roadkill-y.

184
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:10,003
And it comes with a story.

185
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:12,839
"Many years ago,
my daughter, Eliza,

186
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:16,243
brought a runaway slave,
Virgil, to the house."

187
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,246
They made it back
to the house?! How?

188
00:10:19,313 --> 00:10:23,917
<i>The patrollers were too fast
for Eliza and Virgil.</i>

189
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:32,926
<i>Luckily, they chanced upon a
traveling circus...</i>

190
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,099
<i>...where they were helped by a crusty,
old clown.</i>

191
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:42,335
A little schmutz,
a little schmear, and presto!

192
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:44,838
You're part of the
under-clown railroad.

193
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:46,907
So, you got any talent?

194
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:49,209
Well, I am a bit musical.

195
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:52,913
* The sun shines bright *

196
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,284
* On my old Kentucky home. *

197
00:10:57,351 --> 00:11:00,220
Rule number one:
never be better than me.

198
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:01,688
And I'm pretty bad.

199
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:09,062
Nothing to see here--

200
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,932
just a couple of clowns,
and the world's youngest bearded lady.

201
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,834
That I is.

202
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:19,873
Look at her any longer,
you're gonna have to pay a nickel.

203
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:21,975
Why do I always ask for a nickel?

204
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:24,311
That's like 20 bucks in 2010 money.

205
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:28,615
Wait! All that was in the recipe?

206
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:31,284
It was a footnote. See?

207
00:11:31,352 --> 00:11:35,021
"Anyway, I was very proud of Eliza,
but my husband Hiram

208
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:36,890
had not quite caught
abolition fever."

209
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,059
Uh-uh, no way.

210
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:40,961
He'll get me in trouble.

211
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:43,230
Maybe you'll change
your mind about me

212
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:45,932
after you try some
of my wheel cakes.

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,367
Wheel cakes?

214
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,870
They're just
honey-sweetened batter...

215
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:51,004
Go on.

216
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:52,739
...deep-fried in hog lard.

217
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:54,274
Lard, you say.

218
00:11:54,342 --> 00:11:56,877
Then dusted with powdered sugar.

219
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:58,845
You can stay.

220
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:00,313
You swear you'll help him?

221
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,918
I give you my word as
a Southern gentleman.

222
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:06,419
Whoo!

223
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:10,624
So they did the right thing.

224
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:12,225
My quest is fulfilled.

225
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,761
Oufamily has heroes!

226
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:15,996
Shh.

227
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:17,664
Our family has heroes.

228
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:26,161
Martin Luther King had a dream.

229
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:28,096
<i>Dreams are where Elmo
and Toy Story</i>

230
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,265
had a party and I went there.

231
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,501
Yay. My turn is over.

232
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,002
One of your best, Ralph.

233
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,138
Next up, we have Simpson, L.

234
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:39,174
My Black History Month
presentation is called

235
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:41,910
"The Simpsons:
The First Family of Freedom."

236
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,180
No, no, no, not now! Quit, quit!

237
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:48,217
No, don't quit the program,
just the update, you stupid...

238
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,387
Computers, right?

239
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:55,357
Our story begins with a
spunky little spitfire

240
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:57,359
named Eliza Simpson.

241
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:59,995
The year was 1860,
and the Underground Railroad was...

242
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,298
...though Hiram, Mabel, and Eliza

243
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,201
are no longer among us,
their truth goes marching on.

244
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:07,903
Thank you.

245
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:16,178
Bravo, Lisa.

246
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:21,917
Very entertaining, but then again,
fairy tales always are.

247
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,020
What are you talking about?

248
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:28,290
I hold in my hand another diary.

249
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:31,260
That of my great-great-great...

250
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:36,732
...great-great grandfafa,
Milford van Houten.

251
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,769
"April 22nd, 1860..."

252
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:44,373
<i>I was reclining beneath a
sarsaparilla tree,</i>

253
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,108
<i>reading about one</i>

254
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:49,211
<i>of Mr. Thomas Jefferson's
marvelous inventions.</i>

255
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,114
<i>when suddenly I heard
quite a commotion</i>

256
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,415
<i>coming from the Simpson residence.</i>

257
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:54,616
You're lying!

258
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:56,985
Leave me alone!
I have sells to crop.

259
00:13:57,053 --> 00:14:00,222
That's one of Virgil's
sugar-sprinkled cake rings.

260
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,424
Now, where is he?

261
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:05,327
I don't have to answer
to some weak old man

262
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:06,862
with a walking stick.

263
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,163
Ahh! A beating stick!

264
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:09,197
Brigand.

265
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,899
Dastard.

266
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:12,134
Renegade.

267
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:13,602
Mooncalf.

268
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,939
I can't tell you where he is-
I swore an oath.

269
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:19,207
I see.

270
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,278
You know, Simpson,
every man has his price.

271
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:26,915
No one is better at determining
said price than yours truly.

272
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:38,260
I would say your price is...

273
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:40,462
a pleasant surprise.

274
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,798
That's exactly my price.

275
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,199
Your man Virgil is...

276
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:45,367
in...

277
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:46,368
Father, no!

278
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,103
Eliza, hold your tongue!

279
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:50,372
Don't worry, I'll handle this one.

280
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,208
Young lady, in this day and age,

281
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:55,544
women only express their
opinions in diaries

282
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:57,913
to be found long
after they're gone.

283
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,048
From the day you were born,
you were brought up

284
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:02,617
to crave the approval of a man.

285
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:05,220
And I know you really
want to be a good girl,

286
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:08,357
and good girls are
seen and not heard.

287
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,462
Yes, sir.

288
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:14,796
That-a-girl.

289
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,866
Now, where's my man?

290
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:18,834
In the turnip shed.

291
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,102
Now, what's my surprise?

292
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,938
Your surprise is a
new pair of shoes.

293
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:26,241
Oh, my God, that
surprise is so pleasant.

294
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,247
<i>MILFORD After that fateful day,</i>

295
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:37,052
"I could never even
look at Eliza again."

296
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,553
It didn't help that the next day,

297
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,589
he drank bad well
water and went blind.

298
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:41,990
No! You lie!

299
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:45,060
Eliza Simpson can't be a coward.

300
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:47,396
She's the only decent
ancestor I have.

301
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:50,132
Ach. Take it outside, lassie.

302
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,234
We've still got three
"Jackie Robinsons"

303
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,903
and a "Tuskegee Airmen" to go.

304
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:56,638
And so many Obamas.

305
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,873
Yes, we can.

306
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,875
Audacity of hope. Let me be clear.

307
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:05,017
As I told you,
we don't have any books

308
00:16:05,085 --> 00:16:07,153
pertaining to Eliza Simpson.

309
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,221
But I need to prove
that my ancestor

310
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:11,223
couldn't have backed
down to Colonel Burns.

311
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,758
Colonel Burns?

312
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:14,960
Why, I haven't heard my
father's name in years.

313
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:19,899
You know, you could
try our film vault.

314
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:21,000
Huh?

315
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:23,002
We have a film vault?

316
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,204
It's where we hooked up
during the Christmas party.

317
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:26,672
Oh.

318
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:32,411
INTERVIEWER So,
Miss Eliza, I understand

319
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:34,547
you just turned 100.

320
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:37,149
It's been quite a life.

321
00:16:37,217 --> 00:16:38,384
Any regrets?

322
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:39,952
Just one.

323
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,822
When I was a girl,
I witnessed a grave injustice,

324
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:44,390
but I held my tongue.

325
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,226
That pat on my head
from a wicked man

326
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,328
has haunted me to this day.

327
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:57,036
There's no noble Simpson.

328
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:00,272
Oh, you were right, Dad.

329
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,274
I should have quit
while I was ahead

330
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:03,843
instead of learning
the horrible truth

331
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,177
about our family and Virgil.

332
00:17:07,914 --> 00:17:10,316
Aw, don't cry, meat pie.

333
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:12,952
Things worked out pretty
well for Virgil in the end.

334
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:14,553
What are you talking about?

335
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:16,122
Is there something
you know about Virgil

336
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,556
that you haven't told us?

337
00:17:17,624 --> 00:17:19,892
I'll take that secret to my grave--

338
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,595
or urn, or medical
school dissecting table,

339
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:23,696
or wherever you're dumping me.

340
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:25,765
Listen, Wrinkles,

341
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:27,199
if you know something that'll
cheer up my little girl,

342
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:28,834
you'd better spill it.

343
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:32,438
Or I can make things very
uncomfortable for you.

344
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:34,440
That enough?

345
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:36,976
Ah! Okay, I'll talk.

346
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:40,012
D-Day is June 6th. June 6th.

347
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,882
Allied forces will land
on the beaches of Normandy

348
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:45,818
in the following order-- Utah,
Omaha, Gold, Juno.

349
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:47,253
Are you writing this down, Fritz?

350
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,554
About Virgil.

351
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:49,822
Oh, right.

352
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,591
Well, Lisa, Mabel
knew her husband well,

353
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:56,262
<i>so she cooked up a little
payback pie.</i>

354
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:00,833
Get off my property, Colonel Burns.

355
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:03,035
And if I ever see you
in these parts again...

356
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:05,871
...you're gonna be a Memphis belle.

357
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,609
Very well. You may
have won this round,

358
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:13,012
but someday my history will be told

359
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,347
by my descendants
Ken and Ric Burns.

360
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:19,785
I knew you'd break your promise.

361
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:21,720
Now I'm taking Virgil to freedom.

362
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:24,523
<i>You defied your husband for me?</i>

363
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:26,492
<i>Man, this is the '60s.</i>

364
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,294
Now let's take you to a place

365
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:31,330
where a black man can
blend in-- Canada.

366
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,700
<i>So, with those words,</i>

367
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:37,136
<i>Mabel and Virgil headed north,</i>

368
00:18:37,204 --> 00:18:39,705
<i>but their journey was
fraught with peril.</i>

369
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:43,375
Hmm...

370
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:50,082
Mabel, why don't I go on alone,
and you go back to Hiram?

371
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,150
No.

372
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:52,952
There's no life for me with him.

373
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:54,453
I just need to disguise my hair.

374
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:55,487
But how?

375
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:57,590
May I be of assistance?

376
00:18:57,657 --> 00:19:00,092
Abraham Lincoln?!

377
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,795
Perhaps this hat will
help disguise your hair.

378
00:19:02,863 --> 00:19:04,263
Thank you.

379
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,900
How's it look?

380
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:10,069
It makes you look like
a potbellied stove.

381
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:12,071
Hey, hey, "Honest Abe."

382
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:14,540
Oh, I'm a riot.

383
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:17,676
<i>As the border drew close,
so did Virgil and Mabel.</i>

384
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:19,478
After you.

385
00:19:19,546 --> 00:19:23,382
<i>By the time they crossed into Canada,
things had changed.</i>

386
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,786
<i> </i>

387
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:29,788
<i>Mabel she divorced Hiram</i>

388
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:31,724
<i>and got one of his shoes
in the settlement.</i>

389
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:39,698
<i>Mabel and Virgil lived out the
rest of their days in peace.</i>

390
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:42,635
<i>They got married, and since
Virgil had no last name,</i>

391
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,536
<i>they both took the name Simpson</i>

392
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:46,038
<i>so that Mabel could keep</i>

393
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:48,707
<i>all her monogrammed table linens.</i>

394
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:52,177
<i>And their son, Abraham Simpson,</i>

395
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,380
<i>was my great-grandfather.</i>

396
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:02,488
So you're actually descended
from Virgil, not Hiram.

397
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:04,023
Are ya happy?

398
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,791
Yes. I'm thrilled.

399
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:08,193
We've regained our family honor,

400
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:10,729
<i>and we're 1/64th black.</i>

401
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:13,198
So that's why I'm so cool.

402
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,434
That's why my jazz is so smooth.

403
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:18,437
And that's why I earn less
than my white co-workers.

404
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:19,939
Grampa, why'd you try to

405
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:21,740
keep us from finding this out?

406
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:24,710
Well, it's hard to explain
this to a young person,

407
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:28,647
but people of my
generation are, you know...

408
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:30,482
Racists? That's it.

409
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,651
I don't know what the big deal is.

410
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:35,821
I mean, it never bothered any
of you that my father's French.

411
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,723
You know, Bouvier?

412
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,326
So that's why I love
drinking so much.

413
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:42,194
I'm French, not you.

414
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:44,463
<i>C'est la vie, baby.</i>
