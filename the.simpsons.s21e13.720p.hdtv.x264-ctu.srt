00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,636
I'll have to use me explosives.

3
00:00:57,704 --> 00:01:00,239
Explosives? Great.

4
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:02,307
If we put charges on
the load-bearing walls,

5
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,642
we can blow up detention hall

6
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,111
while leaving the
art room unharmed.

7
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:07,513
Hmm? Hey, I like art, okay?

8
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,282
I'm blowing up the stump,
not the school.

9
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,251
Right, right.

10
00:01:12,318 --> 00:01:13,819
You never saw that.

11
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:26,265
Well done, boy.

12
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:27,533
Wait, here comes the "mykeeyah."

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,967
What's a mykeeyah?

14
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:32,504
My Kia!

15
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:34,907
(both laughing)

16
00:01:34,974 --> 00:01:37,442
I'm laughing to fit in,
but I still don't get it.

17
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:41,046
Miss Hoover,
what's our lesson today?

18
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:42,915
Is it school?

19
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,487
Oh, I don't know. Let's see.

20
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:51,957
Family trees.

21
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:54,893
Who here knows what
a family tree is?

22
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:56,428
Oh, family trees--

23
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,097
the charts representing
genealogical relationships

24
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:01,066
in a branching structure.

25
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:02,467
Very good, Lisa.

26
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:04,236
Class, your assignment
over the weekend will be

27
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:06,171
to make your own family tree,

28
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,608
emphasizing any notable or
distinguished ancestors.

29
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:12,144
I can't wait to see
what noble branches lie

30
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:14,713
in the Simpson family foliage.

31
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:15,747
(exclaims)

32
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:19,151
No, this can't be right.

33
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:21,720
Yech, they're all horrible.

34
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:25,190
Yeah, the Simpson family is a
long line of horse thieves,

35
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:29,061
deadbeats, horse beats,
dead thieves, and even a few...

36
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:31,396
(whispering):...alcoholics.

37
00:02:31,464 --> 00:02:33,398
There must have been
some good ancestors.

38
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:35,167
Grampa,

39
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:36,768
don't you know any? Not a one.

40
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:39,471
Maybe the nicest was
Abigail Simpson,

41
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:42,074
who you know as the
Pittsburgh Poisoner.

42
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:43,375
Listen, Lisa, you're going to find

43
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:44,843
more than you bargained for.

44
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:47,512
If I were you,
I wouldn't dig into the past.

45
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,316
I lived in some of that past,
and I got out for a reason.

46
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,452
I won't give up.
I have to know that somewhere

47
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,988
in the muck and the mire and
the Pittsburgh Poisoners,

48
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:57,723
this family had a noble spark,

49
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,993
and I will find it, even if I
have to go back to Adam and Eve.

50
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,327
Oh, you mean

51
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:03,762
Adam and Eve Simpson,

52
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,466
or as you may know them,
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

53
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,201
(groans)

54
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:11,036
(grunting)

55
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:13,138
Ooh! Whoa!

56
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:19,344
Well, are you going
to help me or what?

57
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,852
(cracking)

58
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:35,394
Thank you.

59
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:37,596
So, what are you looking for?

60
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:40,332
Family records for a school
project on genealogical...

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,401
Hey, that's great.

62
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:58,483
Hey, Dad's idea pad.

63
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:01,219
<i>Bicentennial issue of
Reader's Digest.</i>

64
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,455
Old ad for Buzz Cola.

65
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:05,757
(gasps)

66
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:08,160
So dusty.

67
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:16,802
The "Diary of Eliza Simpson"?

68
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:19,871
This entry is dated April 14, 1860.

69
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,907
I warn you: I don't
know what's in there,

70
00:04:21,974 --> 00:04:25,110
but if it's about a Simpson,
you ain't gonna be proud.

71
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:28,413
Our ancestors were
kicked out of Australia.

72
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,815
Oh, stop.

73
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:31,950
It's the journal of
a sweet little girl.

74
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:33,018
Keep reading, honey.

75
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,386
"Dearest diary,

76
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:36,588
today I am the happiest
girl in Springfield..."

77
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:38,423
See, all good.

78
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:41,359
"...because tomorrow I shall
get my very first slave."

79
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:42,327
(all gasp)

80
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:46,513
I can't believe we're
descended from slave owners.

81
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:48,081
Me neither.

82
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:49,983
For once, the Simpsons
were in management.

83
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,218
Homer.

84
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:54,588
Oh, read a little more, honey.

85
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,557
"Saturday, April 14, 1860.

86
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,426
"Dear Diary, I must be brief,

87
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:01,294
"for tonight is the grand ball

88
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:03,463
at Colonel Burns's plantation."

89
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:05,498
I shall dress myself in finery,

90
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,367
like a well-to-do Southern belle.

91
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:08,702
What's for dinner?

92
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:12,205
Possum. Oh, can't we have opossum?

93
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:13,740
Not on your salary.

94
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:17,444
I can't believe I buttoned
my britches for this.

95
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:20,247
In my elegant gown,
no one will suspect

96
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:22,249
that I'm actually
on a mission to help

97
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:24,651
my very first slave
escape to freedom.

98
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:27,287
Yes! She wasn't a slave owner.

99
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:30,523
Our family was on the
Underground Railroad.

100
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:32,993
We ran a subway station?

101
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,594
No, the Underground Railroad

102
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:37,097
was a bunch of people who
helped slaves escape to Canada.

103
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:39,599
There were no actual trains
and it wasn't under ground.

104
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:42,335
Then they should've called it
the Aboveground Normal-Road.

105
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:44,004
Good point, Bart. Absolutely.

106
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:45,505
Hadn't thought of that before.
Very good, Bart.

107
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:47,374
That's a great story, Lisa!

108
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,910
And you should stop
reading right there.

109
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:52,579
Wh-What are you doing?

110
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,180
I want to know what happens next.

111
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:55,482
Well, I don't.

112
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:57,317
The motto of the Simpsons is:

113
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:58,785
"Quit while you're ahead."

114
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,253
I made it into a sampler.

115
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:04,090
It's like when your
father and I left

116
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:07,060
<i>the movie Carrie right after she
was crowned prom queen.</i>

117
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:09,095
She was so happy.

118
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:11,631
She had a lot of problems,
but they were all behind her.

119
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,966
But, but, but-but-but...

120
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:14,434
Time for bed, sweetie.

121
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:15,402

124
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,245
<i>I've got so much more to tell you.</i>

125
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:31,384
I must know.

127
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,093

128
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:46,032
You still reading that thing?

129
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,035
I'm warning you: When
something goes into that vent,

130
00:06:49,103 --> 00:06:50,637
it shouldn't come out...

131
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:52,605
ever.

132
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:54,607
<i>Well, I am reading it,
and when I'm finished,</i>

133
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,543
I'm going to use Eliza's diary

134
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,611
for my "Black History
Month" presentation.

135
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,146
Ooh, good idea.

136
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:02,449
Bart, what are you doing
for Black History Month?

137
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:05,085
I got an idea:
You can march to Selma,

138
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:06,286
and tell her she's ugly!

139
00:07:06,354 --> 00:07:07,587
(laughs)

140
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:09,089

All music needs a four!

Actually, I'm here to help you.

167

Follow me north to freedom.
I don't think so.

168
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:27,100
Why? Because I'm young
and I'm a woman?

169
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:28,668
No, because you're pointing south.

After them! Obviously.

180
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:49,856
Well, you didn't say it.

181
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:51,591
(horses neighing)

182
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,493
<i>Hearts pounding,
we fled into the woods,</i>

183
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:55,095
<i>but their horses were fast.</i>

184
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:58,698
(horses neighing)

185
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:12,846
<i>Escape seemed impossible.</i>

186
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:14,280
(neighing)

187
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:15,782
(crumbling)

188
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,550
<i>MARGE: What happened next?</i>

189
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:20,353
Uh, bu... That's all theres.

190
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:22,422
The rest of the diary
has turned to dust.

191
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,124
(sniffs, sneezes)

192
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:26,359
(snapping)

193
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:30,263
Oh! I'll never know if Eliza
got Virgil safely to freedom.

194
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:32,098
Cheer up, sweetie.

195
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,601
Maybe we can find the
answer in the library.

196
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:36,336
To the reference desk!

197
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,439
The library?

198
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:41,941
Bart, can you believe we're
married to those nerds?

199
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:43,776
(both laugh)

200
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,245
<i>LIBRARIAN: There are no books</i>

201
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:48,348
about an Eliza Simpson,
but I did find this.

202
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:49,749
MARGE: Ooh, a cookbook.

203
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:50,950
(Marge gasps)

204
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:53,286
That's Eliza's mother!

205
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:55,255
Martha, you are the best!

206
00:09:57,591 --> 00:09:59,959
MARGE: "Pork Butt in Cream,
" "Snout-Fried Neck,"

207
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:02,595
"Frog-Haunch," "Hooves Au Jus,"

208
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:04,397
"Possum Pouch Pie..."

209
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:06,900
Please don't make those recipes.

210
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:08,701
This one doesn't sound roadkill-y.

211
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:10,503
And it comes with a story.

212
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:13,339
"Many years ago,
my daughter, Eliza,

213
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:16,743
brought a runaway slave,
Virgil, to the house."

214
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,746
(gasps) They made it
back to the house?! How?

215
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:24,417
<i>MARGE: The patrollers were too
fast for Eliza and Virgil.</i>

216
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:29,189
(owl hooting)

217
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:33,426
<i>Luckily, they chanced upon a
traveling circus...</i>

218
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,599
<i>...where they were helped by a crusty,
old clown.</i>

219
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:42,835
A little schmutz,
a little schmear, and presto!

220
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:45,338
You're part of the
under-clown railroad.

221
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:47,407
So, you got any talent?

222
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,709
Well, I am a bit musical.

223
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:53,413
* The sun shines bright *

224
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,784
* On my old Kentucky home. *

225
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:00,720
Rule number one:
never be better than me.

226
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:02,188
And I'm pretty bad.

227
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,562
Nothing to see here--

228
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,432
just a couple of clowns,
and the world's youngest bearded lady.

229
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,334
That I is.

230
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:20,373
Look at her any longer,
you're gonna have to pay a nickel.

231
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:22,475
Why do I always ask for a nickel?

232
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:24,811
That's like 20 bucks in 2010 money.

233
00:11:26,413 --> 00:11:29,115
Wait! All that was in the recipe?

234
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:31,784
It was a footnote. See?

235
00:11:31,852 --> 00:11:35,521
"Anyway, I was very proud of Eliza,
but my husband Hiram

236
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:37,390
had not quite caught
abolition fever."

237
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,559
Uh-uh, no way.

238
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:41,461
He'll get me in trouble.

239
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:43,730
Maybe you'll change
your mind about me

240
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:46,432
after you try some
of my wheel cakes.

241
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,867
Wheel cakes?

242
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:50,370
They're just
honey-sweetened batter...

243
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:51,504
Go on.

244
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:53,239
...deep-fried in hog lard.

245
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:54,774
Lard, you say.

246
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:57,377
Then dusted with powdered sugar.

247
00:11:57,444 --> 00:11:59,345
(muffled): You can stay.

248
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:00,813
You swear you'll help him?

249
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:02,682
(gulps)

250
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,418
I give you my word as
a Southern gentleman.

251
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:06,919
Whoo! (gulps)

252
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:11,124
So they did the right thing.

253
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,725
My quest is fulfilled.

254
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:15,261
Oufamily has heroes!

255
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:16,496
Shh.

256
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:18,164
(softly): Our family has heroes.

257
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:19,632
(quiet chuckle)

258
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:26,661
Martin Luther King had a dream.

259
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:28,596
<i>Dreams are where Elmo
and Toy Story</i>

260
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,765
had a party and I went there.

261
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,001
Yay. My turn is over.

262
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:34,502
One of your best, Ralph.

263
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,638
Next up, we have Simpson, L.

264
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,674
My Black History Month
presentation is called

265
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:42,410
"The Simpsons:
The First Family of Freedom."

266
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,680
No, no, no, not now! Quit, quit!

267
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:48,717
No, don't quit the program,
just the update, you stupid...

268
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:50,919
(awkward chuckle)

269
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:52,887
Computers, right?

270
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:55,857
Our story begins with a
spunky little spitfire

271
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:57,859
named Eliza Simpson.

272
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:00,495
The year was 1860,
and the Underground Railroad was...

273
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:02,297
("The Battle Hymn of
the Republic" playing)

274
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,798
...though Hiram, Mabel, and Eliza

275
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,701
are no longer among us,
their truth goes marching on.

276
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:08,403
(applause) Thank you.

277
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:12,340
(applause stops) (one
person clapping slowly)

278
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:16,678
Bravo, Lisa.

279
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:22,417
Very entertaining, but then again,
fairy tales always are.

280
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:23,651
(all gasping)

281
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,520
What are you talking about?

282
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:28,790
I hold in my hand another diary.

283
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:31,760
That of my great-great-great...

284
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:33,428
(takes hit from inhaler)

285
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:37,232
...great-great grandfafa,
Milford van Houten.

286
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:38,600
(audience murmurs)

287
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:41,269
"April 22nd, 1860..."

288
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:44,873
<i>(strong Southern accent): I was reclining
beneath a sarsaparilla tree,</i>

289
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,608
<i>reading about one</i>

290
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:49,711
<i>of Mr. Thomas Jefferson's
marvelous inventions.</i>

291
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,614
<i>when suddenly I heard
quite a commotion</i>

292
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:53,915
<i>coming from the Simpson residence.</i>

293
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,116
BURNS: You're lying!

294
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:57,485
BURNS: Leave me alone!
I have sells to crop.

295
00:13:57,553 --> 00:14:00,722
That's one of Virgil's
sugar-sprinkled cake rings.

296
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,924
Now, where is he?

297
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:05,827
I don't have to answer
to some weak old man

298
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,362
with a walking stick.

299
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,663
Ahh! A beating stick!

300
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:09,697
Brigand.

301
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,399
(screams) Dastard.

302
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:12,634
Renegade.

303
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:14,102
Mooncalf.

304
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,439
I can't tell you where he is-
I swore an oath.

305
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:19,707
I see.

306
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,778
You know, Simpson,
every man has his price.

307
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:27,415
No one is better at determining
said price than yours truly.

308
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:38,760
I would say your price is...

309
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:40,962
a pleasant surprise.

310
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,298
That's exactly my price.

311
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:44,699
Your man Virgil is...

312
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:45,867
in...

313
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:46,868
Father, no!

314
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:48,603
Eliza, hold your tongue!

315
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,872
Don't worry, I'll handle this one.

316
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,708
Young lady, in this day and age,

317
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:56,044
women only express their
opinions in diaries

318
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:58,413
to be found long
after they're gone.

319
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,548
From the day you were born,
you were brought up

320
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:03,117
to crave the approval of a man.

321
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,720
And I know you really
want to be a good girl,

322
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:08,857
and good girls are
seen and not heard.

323
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,326
(stifled protest)

324
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,962
Yes, sir.

325
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:15,296
That-a-girl.

326
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,366
Now, where's my man?

327
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:19,334
In the turnip shed.

328
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:20,602
Now, what's my surprise?

329
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,438
Your surprise is a
new pair of shoes.

330
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,741
Oh, my God, that
surprise is so pleasant.

331
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:30,678
(sobbing)

332
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:32,747
<i>MILFORD (with Southern accent):
After that fateful day,</i>

333
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:37,552
(normal voice): "I could never
even look at Eliza again."

334
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,053
It didn't help that the next day,

335
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:41,089
he drank bad well
water and went blind.

336
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:42,490
No! You lie!

337
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:45,560
Eliza Simpson can't be a coward.

338
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:47,896
(voice breaking): She's the
only decent ancestor I have.

339
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:50,632
Ach. Take it outside, lassie.

340
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,734
We've still got three
"Jackie Robinsons"

341
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:55,403
and a "Tuskegee Airmen" to go.

342
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:57,138
(crying) And so many Obamas.

343
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,373
(all impersonating
Obama) Yes, we can.

344
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,375
Audacity of hope. Let me be clear.

345
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:05,417
As I told you,
we don't have any books

346
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:07,553
pertaining to Eliza Simpson.

347
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,621
But I need to prove
that my ancestor

348
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:11,623
couldn't have backed
down to Colonel Burns.

349
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,158
Colonel Burns?

350
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:15,360
Why, I haven't heard my
father's name in years.

351
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:17,629
(sobbing)

352
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:20,299
You know, you could
try our film vault.

353
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:21,400
Huh?

354
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:23,402
We have a film vault?

355
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,604
It's where we hooked up
during the Christmas party.

356
00:16:25,672 --> 00:16:27,072
Oh.

357
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:32,811
INTERVIEWER (on film): So,
Miss Eliza, I understand

358
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,947
you just turned 100.

359
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:37,549
It's been quite a life.

360
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:38,784
Any regrets?

361
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:40,352
Just one.

362
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,222
When I was a girl,
I witnessed a grave injustice,

363
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:44,790
but I held my tongue.

364
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:47,626
That pat on my head
from a wicked man

365
00:16:47,694 --> 00:16:49,728
has haunted me to this day.

366
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:54,399
(sobbing)

367
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:57,436
There's no noble Simpson.

368
00:16:57,504 --> 00:17:00,672
Oh, you were right, Dad.

369
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,674
I should have quit
while I was ahead

370
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:04,243
instead of learning
the horrible truth

371
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,577
about our family and Virgil.

372
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:10,716
Aw, don't cry, meat pie.

373
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:13,352
Things worked out pretty
well for Virgil in the end.

374
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:14,953
What are you talking about?

375
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:16,522
Is there something
you know about Virgil

376
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,956
that you haven't told us?

377
00:17:18,024 --> 00:17:20,292
I'll take that secret to my grave--

378
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,995
or urn, or medical
school dissecting table,

379
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:24,096
or wherever you're dumping me.

380
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,165
Listen, Wrinkles,

381
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:27,599
if you know something that'll
cheer up my little girl,

382
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,234
you'd better spill it.

383
00:17:29,302 --> 00:17:32,838
Or I can make things very
uncomfortable for you.

384
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:34,840
That enough?

385
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:37,376
Ah! Okay, I'll talk.

386
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:40,412
D-Day is June 6th.
Repeat: June 6th.

387
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,282
Allied forces will land
on the beaches of Normandy

388
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:46,218
in the following order-- Utah,
Omaha, Gold, Juno.

389
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:47,653
Are you writing this down, Fritz?

390
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,954
About Virgil.

391
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:50,222
Oh, right.

392
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,991
Well, Lisa, Mabel
knew her husband well,

393
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:56,662
<i>so she cooked up a little
payback pie.</i>

394
00:17:57,864 --> 00:17:58,897
(gasps)

395
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:01,233
Get off my property, Colonel Burns.

396
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:03,435
And if I ever see you
in these parts again...

397
00:18:03,503 --> 00:18:04,703
(shotgun cocking)

398
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:06,271
...you're gonna be a Memphis belle.

399
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,009
Very well. You may
have won this round,

400
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:13,412
but someday my history will be told

401
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,747
by my descendants
Ken and Ric Burns.

402
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:20,185
I knew you'd break your promise.

403
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:22,120
Now I'm taking Virgil to freedom.

404
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,923
<i>You defied your husband for me?</i>

405
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:26,892
<i>Man, this is the '60s.</i>

406
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,694
Now let's take you to a place

407
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:31,730
where a black man can
blend in-- Canada.

408
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,100
<i>GRAMPA: So, with those words,</i>

409
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:37,536
<i>Mabel and Virgil headed north,</i>

410
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:40,105
<i>but their journey was
fraught with peril.</i>

411
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:41,173
(gasps)

412
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:43,775
Hmm...

413
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:50,482
Mabel, why don't I go on alone,
and you go back to Hiram?

414
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,550
No.

415
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,352
There's no life for me with him.

416
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:54,853
I just need to disguise my hair.

417
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:55,887
But how?

418
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:57,990
May I be of assistance?

419
00:18:58,057 --> 00:19:00,492
Abraham Lincoln?! (gasps)

420
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,195
Perhaps this hat will
help disguise your hair.

421
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:04,663
Thank you.

422
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:08,300
How's it look?

423
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:10,469
It makes you look like a
potbellied stove. (annoyed grunt)

424
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,471
Hey, hey, "Honest Abe."

425
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:14,940
(laughs) Oh, I'm a riot.

426
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:18,076
<i>GRAMPA: As the border drew close,
so did Virgil and Mabel.</i>

427
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:19,878
After you.

428
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:23,782
<i>By the time they crossed into Canada,
things had changed.</i>

429
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,186
<i>(theme from Ken Burns's The
Civil War playing)</i>

430
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:30,188
<i>Mabel she divorced Hiram</i>

431
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,124
<i>and got one of his shoes
in the settlement.</i>

432
00:19:35,728 --> 00:19:40,098
<i>Mabel and Virgil lived out the
rest of their days in peace.</i>

433
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,035
<i>They got married, and since
Virgil had no last name,</i>

434
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:44,936
<i>they both took the name Simpson</i>

435
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:46,438
<i>so that Mabel could keep</i>

436
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:49,107
<i>all her monogrammed table linens.</i>

437
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:52,577
<i>And their son, Abraham Simpson,</i>

438
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:54,780
<i>was my great-grandfather.</i>

439
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:02,888
So you're actually descended
from Virgil, not Hiram.

440
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:04,423
Are ya happy?

441
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,191
Yes. I'm thrilled.

442
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:08,593
We've regained our family honor,

443
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:11,129
<i>and we're 1/64th black.</i>

444
00:20:11,197 --> 00:20:13,598
So that's why I'm so cool.

445
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,834
That's why my jazz is so smooth.

446
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:18,837
And that's why I earn less
than my white co-workers.

447
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:20,339
Grampa, why'd you try to

448
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:22,140
keep us from finding this out?

449
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,110
Well, it's hard to explain
this to a young person,

450
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:29,047
but people of my
generation are, you know...

451
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:30,882
Racists? That's it.

452
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,051
I don't know what the big deal is.

453
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,221
I mean, it never bothered any
of you that my father's French.

454
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,123
You know, Bouvier?

455
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:40,726
So that's why I love
drinking so much.

456
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:42,594
I'm French, not you.

457
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:44,863
<i>C'est la vie, baby.</i>

458
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:46,865

459
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:48,700
